                Academics are known to engage in large depths of analysis behind
                their journals, reports, and projects. A reliable ranking of the
                universities can allow for further analysis on the quality and
                impact of their education and research. In turn, this analysis
                can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of different
                institutions and help you make informed decisions about your
                academic future.

Your own personal rank acts as an identifier of your success and establishment, putting you on the forefront as an academic, and not just a university professor.
