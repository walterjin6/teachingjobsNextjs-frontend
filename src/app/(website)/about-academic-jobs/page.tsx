              Academic Jobs was founded by a team of higher ed professionals who
              were frustrated with the lack of transparency and efficiency in
              the academic job market. Put simply, they thought that the old job
              boards out there for academic positions did not work for clients,
              and they continued to operate on very old, outdated technology.
              They therefore have created the best academic job platform in the
              world today... making it easier for candidates to search for jobs,
              compare offers, and communicate with employers. They have also
              provided employers with a cost-effective and user-friendly way to
              advertise their vacancies, reach a global talent pool, and manage
              their applications.
            </p>
