      <article class="blog-content">
        <p>So, you’ve made the decision to find a new role. It can be a daunting experience, but if you’ve covered all your bases before you click that search button, it’ll make life a lot easier. After a pretty difficult year, teachers are back on the move – looking for the next step in their career now the path out of lockdown and restrictions is in sight.</p>
  
        <p>We’ve got some advice for job seekers out there, from preparing to apply, to what to do at interview. All it takes is a little time and effective planning – every other part of being a teacher is planned beforehand, why not job hunting too?</p>
  
        <h2>Triple check your social media</h2>
        <p>Those in education have to be particularly careful around their social media profiles due to the prying eyes of students. Double – no, triple check your privacy settings on each of your pages before applying to any roles. Not only will the pupils social stalk you, but your future employer may have a look too and you don’t want some dodgy photos from your uni days darkening their perception of you before you’ve even got a foot in the door.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, if you have any personal website or blogs, remove them if they’re no longer appropriate or, if they show off your skills or passion for an extracurricular, screen them to make sure they’re work-friendly and feel free to share them on your CV.</p>
  
        <h2>Choose your email address wisely</h2>
        <p>If your email address resembles something you wish you’d left back in the days of MSN, now’s the time to pick a new one. It’s likely your application will get a few raised eyebrows if they’re emailing munchkin_tamz_101 for an interview. Use your name or initials, something professional to avoid any embarrassed blushes.</p>
  
        <p>While you’re there, check your email signature is appropriate and if you have a photo attached to your account, choose a formal head shot or at least a selfie that shows your professional side.</p>
  
        <h2>Do your homework</h2>
        <p>There’s no point blanket-applying to multiple schools. They’ll see right through it and it won’t set you apart from the rest. Research the places you’re applying to. Think about why you want to work for them and what you can bring to the role. This research will also provide good talking points at interview and shows you have a genuine interest in them.</p>
  
        <p>Update your CV and be specific in your cover letter</p>
        <p>This is where that homework comes in handy. Keep your CV up to date and tailor it to each role you’re applying for. Are you hitting all the right notes in the job description? Are you pointing out you have what they’re looking for and can prove it in your cover letter? If you’re singing from the same hymn sheet as the school in your application, you’re more likely to be shortlisted for interview. Seek a second opinion with your CV, ask another teacher friend or a CV expert to look over it before you send it out there. A fresh pair of eyes can never hurt.</p>
  
        <p>If you’re on LinkedIn (which you probably should be), modify your profile to match the role you want. Be the ideal candidate they’re looking for before they even speak to you.</p>
  
        <h2>Speak to a specialist</h2>
        <p>When you’re ready to officially start looking for a job, speak to our recruitment agency. Team up the dual power of job hunting online using our job board with support from our dedicated team who can help you find permanent, long-term or day-to-day supply work for teaching, SEN and support roles both in the UK and international schools.</p>
  
        <h2>Prepare for all forms of interview</h2>
        <p>Your initial interview process may still include a video interview before being invited in. Prep the space around you before that camera goes live. Your background should be clear of dirty socks or poorly positioned baby photos.</p>
  
        <p>Being prepared for any eventuality will put you in good stead. Read the invitation to interview very carefully and think of anything they could throw at you. Plan your example lesson, consider questions you could be asked and request an informal discussion with the head or a tour of the school prior to interview. This will convey your sincere interest in the school and once again provide ample talking points when you come face to face with the hiring team.</p>
  
        <h2>Stay on top of your correspondence</h2>
        <p>Be prompt in your responses when speaking with the school and don’t forget to check your spam in case that Teams invite has ended up in there! Keep your references in the loop as well, your future employer will be sure to contact them prior to offering you a position.</p>
  
        <p>Weren’t successful at interview? Follow up and request feedback. Every day’s a school day and there’s no harm in learning what you could improve on for the next one.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>As schools gear up for Term 1, many are looking to the learnings from 2020 to chart a path forward that ensures their students and staff are not only ready for the school year, but prepared to navigate the kinds of disruptions that brought the education sector to a standstill during the early half of last year.</p>
  
      <p>In May 2020, a survey by researchers from James Cook University asked teachers how COVID-19 affected them and their students. A significant increase in their workload as well as a scramble to obtain technology access and the skills to use new apps and programs was noted.</p>
  
      <p>Indeed, some experts have highlighted the need for principals to look inward, specifically to their IT teams, who possess the most knowledge and expertise when it comes to the technical side of remote learning. After all, a repeat of the widespread school closures seen in 2020 is not beyond the realms of possibility as some states see new outbreaks of COVID-19.</p>
  
      <p>Iain Finlayson, managing director of libraries and education at Civica, said that if schools are to future-proof themselves from disruption, they must take proactive steps to shore up their IT systems.</p>
  
      <p>“As lockdowns continued past a few weeks, as they did in some states, a lack of accessibility to back-office functions and systems for administration and finance became an internal issue for some schools, whereas those schools that had already made a change to cloud-delivered administration systems often did not experience any,” Finlayson told The Educator.</p>
  
      <p>“The schools that experienced a long and protracted closure will have an excellent view on what worked and what didn’t from a system view.”</p>
  
      <p>Finlayson said that as Term 1 approaches, Civica is encouraging schools to share and use these experiences to create an action plan so they are prepared for similar situations in 2021.</p>
  
      <p>“With the accelerated uptake that came for learning management system tools in 2020, we’d encourage schools to be looking now at cloud-delivered solutions for core systems,” he said.</p>
  
      <p>“One way of achieving this is moving to a new cloud-delivered platform which is a large change for any establishment.”</p>
  
      <p>Finlayson said an alternative is to take the current system to the cloud so that it is accessible, and risk is minimalized.</p>
  
      <p>“This will also mean individual components such as administration and finance can then be updated as and when needed with minimal disruption,” he said.</p>
  
      <p>“Schools should look to providers who can support integration options with LMS and other systems.”</p>
  
      <p>Another emerging risk Finlayson pointed to was schools not being able to conduct core administrative tasks due to inadequate learning management systems.</p>
  
      <p>“Learning management systems and core administration systems are distinct. A strong administration system provides all information to a school and is the backbone that all other systems integrate with,” he said.</p>
  
      <p>“If an administration system cannot integrate with an LMS, school staff are required to manually undertake integration between the two which can lead to errors, increased costs, or prove too difficult and lead to systems that become disjointed.”</p>
  
      <p>Finlayson said this can lead to issues with reporting, class assignment, which may go unnoticed, with pupils left behind in work without the efforts of teachers to maintain a close eye as they are left to chase up with IT.</p>
  
      <p>“Confidence that systems can work together is paramount. Looking into the year ahead, one of the biggest concerns in the education sector when it comes to the ability to thrive online is equity”.</p>
  
      <p>Finlayson said the last year has highlighted that even in 2021, where we may have assumed that a proliferation of personal devices would have closed this, the digital divide has in some ways grown.</p>
  
      <p>“Those children who not just lacked access to suitable devices but also reliable internet in the home and a suitable place to work during lockdowns, were unable to connect reliably and be present in a class, and in some cases dropped off the radar, which will undoubtedly have affected the opportunities that these children have in the future”.</p>

      <article class="blog-content">
        <p>According to reports, Australia risks losing more than 4,000 additional lives to suicide in the next five years because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 7,000 extra lives lost seen as a worst-case scenario.</p>
  
        <p>Last year, youth mental health service Headspace said it experienced a 50% rise in referrals for young people who were admitted to a hospital emergency department because of a mental health crisis.</p>
  
        <p>While many schools use infrequent surveys to measure wellbeing and engagement of their students, they aren’t designed to provide measures for intervening for individual students.</p>
  
        <p>At Australian Christian College (ACC) Moreton, a school well known for their anti-bullying policies and safe schooling environment, staff have implemented EI Pulse – a 60-second weekly check-in tool that is showing some promising results.</p>
  
        <p>ACC Moreton’s Head of Student Wellbeing, Derek Hughes said the College initially used the Educator Impact teacher professional development tool to help teachers gather data about the professional practice, as it provided a “360 perspective” on their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
  
        <p>“EI approached us about some new software they were working on to help schools with collecting data on wellbeing,” Hughes told The Educator.</p>
  
        <p>“As I was brand new into the role of Head of Wellbeing and Student Services I was keen to accept any help I could in getting a picture of the well-being of our students and data that would help us improve that”.</p>
  
        <p>Hughes said that while EI Pulse collects helpful data on a range of issues that has allowed the College to implement and escalate a range of strategies and programs – particularly around social interaction and resilience in the upper primary and middle school – the most impactful piece of data is the answers to the “How are you feeling” question.</p>
  
        <p>“This allows students, who might not have the words or the courage to approach an adult to simply tick a ‘I need help’ option on the survey,” Hughes said.</p>
  
        <p>“For the children who use this, the result is the adult they request contacts them within 24 hours. Usually the ‘how ya doin’ from that adult is enough, but occasionally deeper issues are uncovered that, otherwise, might have slipped through the net”.</p>
  
        <p>One student at ACC has experienced tremendous growth in their mental wellbeing thanks to the use of the app and being able to discreetly raise concerns and work directly with the school’s Head of Student Wellbeing.</p>
  
        <p>“I’m able to reach out and communicate with teachers, if I need help, I can do that without having to confront, because I struggle with that sometimes,” the student told The Educator.</p>
  
        <p>“As a result, I am getting the help I need more often than in the past”.</p>
  
        <p>EI CEO, Nabil Shaheen, said Pulse provides a facility for at-risk students to “reach out for help at any time, from any device”.</p>
  
        <p>Pulse gives principals unprecedented visibility of their students' wellbeing: both timely and comprehensive - it helps principals demonstrate to parents that their children’s wellbeing is important to the school. Second, it helps at an individual student level,” Shaheen told The Educator.</p>
  
        <p>“Principals are able to identify students that are potentially at risk even if they are remote for lengthy periods of time. It also helps inform school-wide initiatives and react to circumstances with agility. Principals have rapid insight across all aspects of engagement and wellbeing every week”.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Expanding support</strong></p>
  
        <p>EI recently began working with three universities to share its data with the aim of improving the way educational institutions improve the wellbeing of young people.</p>
  
        <p>The company’s co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Dr Joe Thurbon, said there have been some key learnings from EI’s ongoing partnership with ARACY for school leaders.</p>
  
        <p>“We think that leaders gain a simple and comprehensive way to understand their school. By collecting data using a variation of ARACY's Common Approach leaders can rest assured that EI Pulse insights reveal a breadth of student experience,” Thurbon told The Educator.</p>
  
        <p>“The data collected is presented according to The Nest, which was designed by ARACY in collaboration with young people”.</p>
  
        <p>Thurbon said this has enabled schools to talk about these insights with students in a way that “truly resonates”, leading to better engagement. Increasingly leaders are using the data to have more detailed conversations with their students, gaining sometimes surprising insights about their school and about their students.</p>

               <p>The government said the Smiling Mind Regional and Rural Schools Program “will benefit thousands of children a year”. The online program runs over three school terms each year, involving both school staff training in mindfulness and resources to sustain the program and its benefits for the school.</p>
               <p>It will also include assistance for schools to gauge the positive impact the program is having on each school community, as well as ongoing support from psychologists and mindfulness experts.</p>
               <p>Australian school students and their families have faced many challenges over the past year as the nation responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Smiling Minds will ensure more children can access mental health supports, which will help keep their education on track.</p>
               <p>Smiling Mind focuses on building healthy minds, engaged classrooms, and equipping a generation of children with skills they need to thrive in life.</p>
               <p>The program will be available in government, Catholic and independent primary schools in rural or regional communities experiencing disadvantage.</p>
               <p>Rural and regional schools in South Australia and Queensland joined the program in November 2020, which is now open across the entire country.</p>

    <article class="blog-content">
      <p>After losing a Year 9 student to suicide, educator, Rachel Downie decided that she needed to find a way to support our young people to say something when things ‘aren’t right’. She discovered that in emergent situations, students often felt too frightened to come forward with possible life-saving information, due to their social expectations and Australia’s cultural acceptance of bullying. This led Rachel to developing Stymie – harm reporting without fear.</p>
  
      <p>Rachel was recognised for her work with young people at risk of harm, receiving the Queensland Australian of the Year Award in 2020 and she has an important message for educators…</p>
  
      <h2>Challenging Conversations and School Leadership</h2>
  
      <p>How can we challenge a conversation if we lack courage? Rachel believes this is a critical question, especially given recent revelations about sexual assault and issues of consent. She emphasizes the need for education leaders to address these issues.</p>
  
      <p>Rachel highlights the role of schools in addressing concerning societal issues that play out within their walls. She stresses the importance of empowering students to speak up and fostering a culture of openness.</p>
  
      <h2>Concerning Behaviors in 2021</h2>
  
      <p>The effects of COVID-19 have added complexities to school environments. Rachel discusses the challenges schools face in dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic, including increased lack of self-regulation and social integration issues.</p>
  
      <h2>Strategies for Addressing Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
  
      <p>Rachel acknowledges that addressing unacceptable behavior, abuse, and harm is difficult but crucial. She advocates for stronger connections between schools and parents and emphasizes the importance of mental health support.</p>
  
      <h2>Empowering Conversations through Courage</h2>
  
      <p>In her session ‘How can we challenge a conversation if we lack courage’ at the Leadership for Future Focused School conference, Rachel will delve into the coexistence of courage and fear. She encourages educators to step out of their comfort zones to address challenging issues.</p>
  
      <p>By empowering school leaders with the tools and mindset to tackle teen issues, Rachel aims to create safer and more supportive school environments.</p>

    tags: ['Education', 'Reading Strategies', 'Classroom Engagement'],
    keywords: 'whole-class reading, reading strategies, classroom engagement, comprehension, teaching techniques, literacy skills',
    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>After going out of fashion for a while at the expense of guided reading, whole-class reading seems to be back in favour again. Research points to a variety of benefits of whole-class reading. So, how do you make the most of whole-class reading sessions?</p>
      <p>Whole-class reading enables you to focus on more challenging texts. It also allows for better opportunities to engage pupils in class discussion. Furthermore, it makes the deeper exploration of a text more viable and manageable.</p>
      <p>However, you need to be careful with your strategies and approaches if you are to have a real impact on pupil learning with whole-class reading. Follow the following tips to plan whole-class reading activities that have a genuine impact.</p>
      <h2>Choose an appropriate text</h2>
      <p>If whole-class reading is to be effective, the choice of text is everything. It needs to be engaging, obviously. Furthermore, it needs to be totally fit for purpose and suited to the needs of the class. This means that the focus of the lesson should not be based on the text. Instead, focus on the learning needs of the class and choose an appropriate text to match this.</p>
      <h2>The importance of background and context</h2>
      <p>Regardless of the age of the children you are teaching, be aware of what you are ultimately working towards. The assessment criteria for GCSE English Literature leans heavily on the importance of context. What’s more, NFER (National Foundation for Educational Research) guidance stipulates that the most important aspect of language comprehension is background knowledge. Very often, it is the ‘missing link’ when it comes to pupil understanding.</p>
      <h2>Try to make reading a visual experience</h2>
      <p>There are several barriers to reading. Dyslexia is probably the most well-known but is far from the only hurdle that readers face. The inability to form mental images, aphantasia, is a condition that many children and adults suffer from. It often goes undiagnosed, and it can be extremely limiting for those it affects. This is why it is always useful to incorporate diagrams and pictures into the teaching of background, context, and vocabulary.</p>
      <p>This will be a great help for any children who find it difficult to visualize things. It will also be especially helpful for those who have never experienced the context of a text.</p>
      <h2>Read to the class</h2>
      <p>Although there are obvious benefits of children being given the opportunity to read out aloud, with whole-class reading, it is always best for the teacher to read to the class.</p>
      <p>The focus should be on comprehension rather than fluency. They are different skills, but poor fluency will only hamper comprehension. A teacher reading the text will be more fluent than a child. It will also make inference and understanding of emotions and feelings easier to pick up.</p>
      <h2>Mix up pupil activities</h2>
      <p>Reading a section of text followed by a set of comprehension questions is a tried and trusted approach. Of course, this strategy is not without merit or value. However, it can soon become very boring if this is always the pupil activity that follows on from a whole-class reading session.</p>
      <p>There are many different ways in which pupils can explore a text and show their understanding of characters’ feelings. Drama activities are particularly useful and engaging. Anything that breaks the repetitive cycle and the notion that the reading of a text is always followed by written answers to comprehension questions.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>In June, a sector-first research paper found that a “COVID hangover” continues to affect student and staff motivation, anxiety and engagement.</p>
      <p>According to the paper, the majority of the 74 independent school leaders and teachers who took part in the COVID-19 survey between March and April 2021, “felt that the remote learning period had a neutral or negative impact on students” with student wellbeing and social development more negatively impacted than academic progress.</p>
      <p>With schools in NSW and Queensland now dealing with a second wave of the COVID-19 virus and the lockdowns that ensued, there are renewed concerns that young people’s mental health may experience a further decline.</p>
      <h2>Kyllie Power: Leading Wellbeing at Iona College</h2>
      <p>Kyllie Power, Deputy Principal at Iona College in Geelong, has been an educator for more than 25 years, and over that time, has accumulated valuable experience about what works, and what doesn’t, in the all-important areas of social emotional learning and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>This is why in addition to being the school’s deputy principal, Power is also in charge of the school's culture and wellbeing programs – perhaps the most critical type of program in a school’s teaching and learning community.</p>
      <p>Power says recognising the needs of her school’s community and putting relationships at the heart of the school’s culture have been instrumental in the success of Iona College’s wellbeing program.</p>
      <blockquote>“Wellbeing can be successfully supported, and students can flourish when they are connected to caring adults,” Power told <em>The Educator</em>.</blockquote>
      <p>“At Iona we do not need to retrofit wellbeing into our practice, we can build it from the ground up.  We prioritise employing staff that share this vision and promote professional learning in this area both in the reactive interventions but importantly in the preventative science of wellbeing.”</p>
      <p>Power says a common shared language is vital as the school adopts a social emotional curriculum that is based on the best evidence-based practice.</p>
      <p>“Importantly, parents are our partners in this journey, and we share engaging at home learning opportunities via newsletters, parent partnership evenings and social media posts.”</p>
      <h2>Shifting the Paradigm: Preventative Wellbeing Measures</h2>
      <p>Power says there has been a shift away from the reactionary student welfare models of the past in favour of a more preventative, holistic approach.</p>
      <blockquote>“It is exciting to see the science of wellbeing evolving and that preventative measures can be embedded in a holistic way,” she said.</blockquote>
      <p>“No longer do we rely on the reactionary aspects that support our young people, we now balance the need for reaction with the teaching of explicit skills in social emotional learning.”</p>
      <p>Power says the term ‘soft skills’ is outdated and should be replaced with ‘essential skills’.</p>
      <blockquote>“All teachers and support staff at Iona are responsible for ensuring that we integrate this throughout the curriculum,” she said.</blockquote>
      <p>“This requires commitment from leadership in all areas of the College and a deep understanding of wellbeing science. Wellbeing is always on the agenda, staff PD is targeted and ongoing and help seeking is promoted to students by all staff.”</p>
      <h2>Utilizing Technology for Wellbeing</h2>
      <p>Power said using technology to assist the school’s students with help seeking and allowing real-time data to inform where supports need to be placed has been “a game changer.”</p>
      <blockquote>“Year Level Wellbeing leaders and student support staff monitor and use the data from our weekly ei Pulse check ins to ensure students who need help get it in a timely manner,” she said.</blockquote>
      <p>“Normalising the weekly check in and allowing staff time to analyse this data has meant our students feel supported and connected to staff.”</p>
      <p>Power said the regular check-ins allow relationships to strengthen and teachers feel supported when students need further help.</p>
      <blockquote>“As part of our weekly check ins ei Pulse randomises questions on key areas of the College allowing learning and wellbeing needs to be heard – a perfect example of student voice.”</blockquote>
      <h2>Whole-School Approach to Wellbeing</h2>
      <p>Dr Joe Thurbon, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Educator Impact said the company has been working very closely with schools that are looking to put in place an effective system for student wellbeing.</p>
      <blockquote>“It has become very clear that while individual teachers do an incredible job of supporting their students, supporting the whole-student truly is a whole-school effort,” Dr Thurbon told <em>The Educator</em>.</blockquote>
      <p>“Leaning on regular, frequent data truly transforms a school's approach to wellbeing. Iona College uses Educator Impact’s ei Pulse platform every Tuesday to receive updates on student well-being through short, 60 second check-ins.”</p>
      <p>Thurbon said the user-friendly colour-coded responses allow educators to intervene with students who may be struggling — and who otherwise wouldn’t have brought it to the staff’s attention.</p>
      <p>“Students also answer a handful of questions on their experience in school that provide great, actionable data to schools on a range of potential wellbeing and teaching and learning issues.”</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>New South Wales recently announced it would trial different start and finish times for various year levels in primary schools, aiming to alleviate traffic congestion and accommodate the needs of shift-working families.</p>
  
      <p>In Queensland, principals already have the option to stagger school days, offering flexibility such as starting classes at 9:30am and ending at 3:30pm. But how would this system operate, and is there evidence it could yield positive outcomes?</p>
  
      <h2>Teenagers need more sleep</h2>
      <p>Australia’s sleep guidelines recommend ample rest for children and teenagers, yet many fall short of the recommended hours. Lack of sleep can lead to cognitive and behavioral issues, impacting academic performance.</p>
  
      <p>A 2016 study highlighted the importance of sufficient sleep for students and supported the idea of delaying school start times to improve sleep quality.</p>
  
      <h2>What do we know about staggered school times?</h2>
      <p>While research in this area is limited, experiences from schools with nontraditional hours provide insights. For example, a Queensland study explored the effectiveness of split-shift timetables, revealing benefits such as reduced congestion, increased resource access, and better teaching blocks.</p>
  
      <h3>Benefits for students, staff, and communities</h3>
      <p>Staggered school hours offer various advantages, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced congestion and overcrowding</li>
        <li>Enhanced access to resources and staff</li>
        <li>Improved availability of specialist facilities</li>
        <li>Increased opportunities for part-time work and vocational training</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>For staff, the system allows for better teaching blocks, while parents benefit from improved transportation and access to teachers.</p>
  
      <h2>Addressing concerns and future considerations</h2>
      <p>Implementing staggered school times on a wider scale requires addressing logistical challenges and community concerns. Collaboration between the education department and local communities is essential to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
  
      <p>As New South Wales embarks on this trial, insights from other regions, such as the United States, where staggered start times have been successful, can inform decision-making.</p>
  
      <p>With ongoing research and community feedback, the trial in New South Wales has the potential to optimize school schedules for student well-being and community benefit.</p>

      <p>As mum Vanessa helps her 11-year-old daughter Talyah with her homework, the technology is at least familiar: a pen and paper.</p>
  
      <h2>Key Points:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>COVID-19 lockdowns have exposed the digital divide in education</li>
        <li>A Smith Family program is trying to bridge the divide by offering one-on-one teaching</li>
        <li>Some educators believe it is the future of learning</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>But for Talyah, it also creates a problem — much of the rest of her year six class is in a virtual classroom.</p>
  
      <blockquote>
        <p>"It is harder being away from the classroom because I don't have that many people to ask for help," Talyah said. "And I can't ask the teacher because I'm at home. I struggle because it's only me and my mum."</p>
      </blockquote>
  
      <p>Like an estimated 50 per cent of low-income families, Vanessa struggles to pay for internet, leaving her and Talyah with a phone which has poor reception at their home in Fairfield West in outer Sydney.</p>
  
      <p>"I've got a computer but it doesn't work because the dongle ran out of internet," Talyah said.</p>
  
      <p>Right across the country, it's a similar struggle. An estimated one in three Indigenous children do not have internet at home.</p>
  
      <p>But a program from The Smith Family — a program which Talyah is a part of — is trying to change that.</p>
  
      <h2>The Results Are In</h2>
      <p>The experiment found not only did the students stop falling further behind, but in literacy six out of 10 students caught up to or surpassed their classmates.</p>
  
      <p>"The program really helped them engage in their learning," Ms Hampshire said. "But really importantly, it showed that students were able to achieve greater progress than would be typically expected from average students over a six-month program."</p>
  
      <h2>Cheryl Giombi described the program as targeted individual learning.</h2>
      <p>Back in Fairfield West, Talyah said tutoring from the program meant she's wasn't as worried by the latest lockdown-induced disruption to learning.</p>
  
      <p>For Talyah it has also transformed reading and writing from a source of frustration to joy.</p>
  
      <p>Her current struggles are fuelling inspiration to share the transformative power of education.</p>
  
      <p>"I want to be a teacher when I grow up because I like helping students," Talyah said.</p>

        <p>Education leaders across NSW are facing significant challenges as they prepare for the return of staff and senior students to face-to-face learning amidst ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
  
        <p>Recently, concerns have escalated as several local government areas (LGAs) have been placed under lockdown due to the spread of the Delta variant. This has led to heightened anxieties among school communities.</p>
  
        <p>The decision to return to school has prompted calls for clear COVID-safe parameters from the NSW Government. Dr. Geoff Newcombe AM, Chief Executive of the Association of Independent Schools of NSW (AISNSW), emphasizes the need for flexibility, stating, "Independent school principals are experienced administrators who can develop COVID-safe plans tailored to their school's context."</p>
  
        <p>The safety of students and staff remains the top priority for education leaders. Craig Peterson, President of the NSW Secondary Principal’s Council, acknowledges the risks associated with returning to face-to-face learning and urges for caution.</p>
  
        <p>Special education principals, such as Matthew Johnson, President of the Australian Special Education Principals Association, highlight the unique challenges faced by students with complex needs during remote learning. Johnson stresses the importance of prioritizing vaccinations for vulnerable students and their families.</p>
  
        <p>Despite efforts to facilitate remote learning, the absence of in-person interaction poses significant challenges for students with disabilities. Johnson emphasizes the vital role schools play in providing support and routine for these students.</p>
  
        <p>The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic underscores the need for careful planning and collaboration within the education sector. Education leaders continue to navigate the complexities of ensuring a safe and effective learning environment for all students.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>With the emergence of more infectious variants of the COVID-19 virus, high school classrooms have mandated the wearing of masks for both teachers and students. This precaution was particularly stringent in Greater Sydney and all of Victoria, necessitating adherence even during in-person learning before the shift to remote education due to lockdowns.</p>
      
      <p>But what exactly constitutes the best practice for mask usage in the classroom? It's crucial to ensure that while masks are worn, they do not hinder the educational experience or have negative impacts on students.</p>
      
      <p>Dr. David Roy, a Lecturer in Education at the University of Newcastle, has extensively researched the efficacy of masks in educational environments. According to him, there's a widespread acknowledgment that masks play a vital role in preventing airborne infections, hence their necessity within classrooms.</p>
      
      <p>"There are multiple strategies to ensure the effectiveness of masks in the classroom," Dr. Roy explained. "This includes emphasizing facial expressions, using written instructions, and allowing teachers to remove masks when necessary for clear communication, especially for students who rely on lip-reading."</p>
      
      <p>Dr. Roy emphasized the importance of proper mask usage, stating, "A mask is only effective when it covers both the nose and mouth. It should only be handled from the edges, and sharing masks is strongly discouraged. Reusable masks should be washed daily, while single-use masks should be disposed of after a single use."</p>
      
      <p>Highlighting the vulnerability of young people to the Delta Variant, Dr. Roy stressed the significance of embracing masks as a protective measure. "Masks are one of our best forms of defense. Let's utilize every available measure to safeguard our students and staff," he concluded.</p>
      
      <p>Implementing these best practices not only ensures safety within high school classrooms but also promotes an environment conducive to effective learning amidst the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>Year 12 students in Greater Sydney are facing a unique challenge as they prepare for their Higher School Certificate (HSC) amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With concerns escalating over the safety of students, the New South Wales government has announced a <strong>flexible school model</strong> aimed at ensuring essential education and wellbeing support for HSC students.</p>
  
    <p>Under this model, school assessments and trial exams will be completed at home, while access to schools will be limited to small groups of students at any given time starting from August 16th. The decision to implement this model reflects the government's commitment to prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of students in the face of the highly transmissible Delta strain.</p>
  
    <p>NSW Premier <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong> underscored the gravity of the situation, revealing alarming statistics of community transmission. With the number of cases expected to rise, the government is steadfast in its approach to follow health advice while ensuring that HSC students have access to essential education and support.</p>
  
    <p>Education Minister <strong>Sarah Mitchell</strong> emphasized the importance of providing HSC students with the necessary resources to navigate their final months of schooling. A comprehensive and flexible model will enable schools to deliver essential lessons and check-ins with teachers in a safe and sensible manner.</p>
  
    <p>However, students residing in the eight local government areas (LGAs) of concern, including Blacktown, Campbelltown, and Fairfield, will not return to school yet. This cautious approach aims to mitigate the risk of further transmission in high-risk areas.</p>
  
    <p>Efforts are underway to facilitate the vaccination of students in these areas, with Premier Berejiklian announcing eligibility for vaccination starting August 9th. Additionally, discussions are ongoing between school principals, teachers, and relevant authorities to explore all available options to safeguard the health and safety of the school community.</p>
  
    <p>The <strong>NSW Teachers Federation</strong> has raised concerns about the safety of reopening schools, citing the potential risks associated with human interaction in school settings. A special Executive meeting will convene to address these concerns and determine appropriate measures to ensure the safety of students and staff.</p>
  
    <p>In conclusion, the introduction of a flexible school model underscores the government's commitment to prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of Year 12 students. By adapting to the evolving challenges posed by the pandemic, educators and policymakers are working tirelessly to provide students with the support they need to succeed in their academic endeavors.</p>
