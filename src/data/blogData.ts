      <article class="blog-content">
        <p>So, you’ve made the decision to find a new role. It can be a daunting experience, but if you’ve covered all your bases before you click that search button, it’ll make life a lot easier. After a pretty difficult year, teachers are back on the move – looking for the next step in their career now the path out of lockdown and restrictions is in sight.</p>
  
        <p>We’ve got some advice for job seekers out there, from preparing to apply, to what to do at interview. All it takes is a little time and effective planning – every other part of being a teacher is planned beforehand, why not job hunting too?</p>
  
        <h2>Triple check your social media</h2>
        <p>Those in education have to be particularly careful around their social media profiles due to the prying eyes of students. Double – no, triple check your privacy settings on each of your pages before applying to any roles. Not only will the pupils social stalk you, but your future employer may have a look too and you don’t want some dodgy photos from your uni days darkening their perception of you before you’ve even got a foot in the door.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, if you have any personal website or blogs, remove them if they’re no longer appropriate or, if they show off your skills or passion for an extracurricular, screen them to make sure they’re work-friendly and feel free to share them on your CV.</p>
  
        <h2>Choose your email address wisely</h2>
        <p>If your email address resembles something you wish you’d left back in the days of MSN, now’s the time to pick a new one. It’s likely your application will get a few raised eyebrows if they’re emailing munchkin_tamz_101 for an interview. Use your name or initials, something professional to avoid any embarrassed blushes.</p>
  
        <p>While you’re there, check your email signature is appropriate and if you have a photo attached to your account, choose a formal head shot or at least a selfie that shows your professional side.</p>
  
        <h2>Do your homework</h2>
        <p>There’s no point blanket-applying to multiple schools. They’ll see right through it and it won’t set you apart from the rest. Research the places you’re applying to. Think about why you want to work for them and what you can bring to the role. This research will also provide good talking points at interview and shows you have a genuine interest in them.</p>
  
        <p>Update your CV and be specific in your cover letter</p>
        <p>This is where that homework comes in handy. Keep your CV up to date and tailor it to each role you’re applying for. Are you hitting all the right notes in the job description? Are you pointing out you have what they’re looking for and can prove it in your cover letter? If you’re singing from the same hymn sheet as the school in your application, you’re more likely to be shortlisted for interview. Seek a second opinion with your CV, ask another teacher friend or a CV expert to look over it before you send it out there. A fresh pair of eyes can never hurt.</p>
  
        <p>If you’re on LinkedIn (which you probably should be), modify your profile to match the role you want. Be the ideal candidate they’re looking for before they even speak to you.</p>
  
        <h2>Speak to a specialist</h2>
        <p>When you’re ready to officially start looking for a job, speak to our recruitment agency. Team up the dual power of job hunting online using our job board with support from our dedicated team who can help you find permanent, long-term or day-to-day supply work for teaching, SEN and support roles both in the UK and international schools.</p>
  
        <h2>Prepare for all forms of interview</h2>
        <p>Your initial interview process may still include a video interview before being invited in. Prep the space around you before that camera goes live. Your background should be clear of dirty socks or poorly positioned baby photos.</p>
  
        <p>Being prepared for any eventuality will put you in good stead. Read the invitation to interview very carefully and think of anything they could throw at you. Plan your example lesson, consider questions you could be asked and request an informal discussion with the head or a tour of the school prior to interview. This will convey your sincere interest in the school and once again provide ample talking points when you come face to face with the hiring team.</p>
  
        <h2>Stay on top of your correspondence</h2>
        <p>Be prompt in your responses when speaking with the school and don’t forget to check your spam in case that Teams invite has ended up in there! Keep your references in the loop as well, your future employer will be sure to contact them prior to offering you a position.</p>
  
        <p>Weren’t successful at interview? Follow up and request feedback. Every day’s a school day and there’s no harm in learning what you could improve on for the next one.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>As schools gear up for Term 1, many are looking to the learnings from 2020 to chart a path forward that ensures their students and staff are not only ready for the school year, but prepared to navigate the kinds of disruptions that brought the education sector to a standstill during the early half of last year.</p>
  
      <p>In May 2020, a survey by researchers from James Cook University asked teachers how COVID-19 affected them and their students. A significant increase in their workload as well as a scramble to obtain technology access and the skills to use new apps and programs was noted.</p>
  
      <p>Indeed, some experts have highlighted the need for principals to look inward, specifically to their IT teams, who possess the most knowledge and expertise when it comes to the technical side of remote learning. After all, a repeat of the widespread school closures seen in 2020 is not beyond the realms of possibility as some states see new outbreaks of COVID-19.</p>
  
      <p>Iain Finlayson, managing director of libraries and education at Civica, said that if schools are to future-proof themselves from disruption, they must take proactive steps to shore up their IT systems.</p>
  
      <p>“As lockdowns continued past a few weeks, as they did in some states, a lack of accessibility to back-office functions and systems for administration and finance became an internal issue for some schools, whereas those schools that had already made a change to cloud-delivered administration systems often did not experience any,” Finlayson told The Educator.</p>
  
      <p>“The schools that experienced a long and protracted closure will have an excellent view on what worked and what didn’t from a system view.”</p>
  
      <p>Finlayson said that as Term 1 approaches, Civica is encouraging schools to share and use these experiences to create an action plan so they are prepared for similar situations in 2021.</p>
  
      <p>“With the accelerated uptake that came for learning management system tools in 2020, we’d encourage schools to be looking now at cloud-delivered solutions for core systems,” he said.</p>
  
      <p>“One way of achieving this is moving to a new cloud-delivered platform which is a large change for any establishment.”</p>
  
      <p>Finlayson said an alternative is to take the current system to the cloud so that it is accessible, and risk is minimalized.</p>
  
      <p>“This will also mean individual components such as administration and finance can then be updated as and when needed with minimal disruption,” he said.</p>
  
      <p>“Schools should look to providers who can support integration options with LMS and other systems.”</p>
  
      <p>Another emerging risk Finlayson pointed to was schools not being able to conduct core administrative tasks due to inadequate learning management systems.</p>
  
      <p>“Learning management systems and core administration systems are distinct. A strong administration system provides all information to a school and is the backbone that all other systems integrate with,” he said.</p>
  
      <p>“If an administration system cannot integrate with an LMS, school staff are required to manually undertake integration between the two which can lead to errors, increased costs, or prove too difficult and lead to systems that become disjointed.”</p>
  
      <p>Finlayson said this can lead to issues with reporting, class assignment, which may go unnoticed, with pupils left behind in work without the efforts of teachers to maintain a close eye as they are left to chase up with IT.</p>
  
      <p>“Confidence that systems can work together is paramount. Looking into the year ahead, one of the biggest concerns in the education sector when it comes to the ability to thrive online is equity”.</p>
  
      <p>Finlayson said the last year has highlighted that even in 2021, where we may have assumed that a proliferation of personal devices would have closed this, the digital divide has in some ways grown.</p>
  
      <p>“Those children who not just lacked access to suitable devices but also reliable internet in the home and a suitable place to work during lockdowns, were unable to connect reliably and be present in a class, and in some cases dropped off the radar, which will undoubtedly have affected the opportunities that these children have in the future”.</p>

      <article class="blog-content">
        <p>According to reports, Australia risks losing more than 4,000 additional lives to suicide in the next five years because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 7,000 extra lives lost seen as a worst-case scenario.</p>
  
        <p>Last year, youth mental health service Headspace said it experienced a 50% rise in referrals for young people who were admitted to a hospital emergency department because of a mental health crisis.</p>
  
        <p>While many schools use infrequent surveys to measure wellbeing and engagement of their students, they aren’t designed to provide measures for intervening for individual students.</p>
  
        <p>At Australian Christian College (ACC) Moreton, a school well known for their anti-bullying policies and safe schooling environment, staff have implemented EI Pulse – a 60-second weekly check-in tool that is showing some promising results.</p>
  
        <p>ACC Moreton’s Head of Student Wellbeing, Derek Hughes said the College initially used the Educator Impact teacher professional development tool to help teachers gather data about the professional practice, as it provided a “360 perspective” on their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
  
        <p>“EI approached us about some new software they were working on to help schools with collecting data on wellbeing,” Hughes told The Educator.</p>
  
        <p>“As I was brand new into the role of Head of Wellbeing and Student Services I was keen to accept any help I could in getting a picture of the well-being of our students and data that would help us improve that”.</p>
  
        <p>Hughes said that while EI Pulse collects helpful data on a range of issues that has allowed the College to implement and escalate a range of strategies and programs – particularly around social interaction and resilience in the upper primary and middle school – the most impactful piece of data is the answers to the “How are you feeling” question.</p>
  
        <p>“This allows students, who might not have the words or the courage to approach an adult to simply tick a ‘I need help’ option on the survey,” Hughes said.</p>
  
        <p>“For the children who use this, the result is the adult they request contacts them within 24 hours. Usually the ‘how ya doin’ from that adult is enough, but occasionally deeper issues are uncovered that, otherwise, might have slipped through the net”.</p>
  
        <p>One student at ACC has experienced tremendous growth in their mental wellbeing thanks to the use of the app and being able to discreetly raise concerns and work directly with the school’s Head of Student Wellbeing.</p>
  
        <p>“I’m able to reach out and communicate with teachers, if I need help, I can do that without having to confront, because I struggle with that sometimes,” the student told The Educator.</p>
  
        <p>“As a result, I am getting the help I need more often than in the past”.</p>
  
        <p>EI CEO, Nabil Shaheen, said Pulse provides a facility for at-risk students to “reach out for help at any time, from any device”.</p>
  
        <p>Pulse gives principals unprecedented visibility of their students' wellbeing: both timely and comprehensive - it helps principals demonstrate to parents that their children’s wellbeing is important to the school. Second, it helps at an individual student level,” Shaheen told The Educator.</p>
  
        <p>“Principals are able to identify students that are potentially at risk even if they are remote for lengthy periods of time. It also helps inform school-wide initiatives and react to circumstances with agility. Principals have rapid insight across all aspects of engagement and wellbeing every week”.</p>
  
        <p><strong>Expanding support</strong></p>
  
        <p>EI recently began working with three universities to share its data with the aim of improving the way educational institutions improve the wellbeing of young people.</p>
  
        <p>The company’s co-founder and Chief Technology Officer, Dr Joe Thurbon, said there have been some key learnings from EI’s ongoing partnership with ARACY for school leaders.</p>
  
        <p>“We think that leaders gain a simple and comprehensive way to understand their school. By collecting data using a variation of ARACY's Common Approach leaders can rest assured that EI Pulse insights reveal a breadth of student experience,” Thurbon told The Educator.</p>
  
        <p>“The data collected is presented according to The Nest, which was designed by ARACY in collaboration with young people”.</p>
  
        <p>Thurbon said this has enabled schools to talk about these insights with students in a way that “truly resonates”, leading to better engagement. Increasingly leaders are using the data to have more detailed conversations with their students, gaining sometimes surprising insights about their school and about their students.</p>

               <p>The government said the Smiling Mind Regional and Rural Schools Program “will benefit thousands of children a year”. The online program runs over three school terms each year, involving both school staff training in mindfulness and resources to sustain the program and its benefits for the school.</p>
               <p>It will also include assistance for schools to gauge the positive impact the program is having on each school community, as well as ongoing support from psychologists and mindfulness experts.</p>
               <p>Australian school students and their families have faced many challenges over the past year as the nation responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. Smiling Minds will ensure more children can access mental health supports, which will help keep their education on track.</p>
               <p>Smiling Mind focuses on building healthy minds, engaged classrooms, and equipping a generation of children with skills they need to thrive in life.</p>
               <p>The program will be available in government, Catholic and independent primary schools in rural or regional communities experiencing disadvantage.</p>
               <p>Rural and regional schools in South Australia and Queensland joined the program in November 2020, which is now open across the entire country.</p>

    <article class="blog-content">
      <p>After losing a Year 9 student to suicide, educator, Rachel Downie decided that she needed to find a way to support our young people to say something when things ‘aren’t right’. She discovered that in emergent situations, students often felt too frightened to come forward with possible life-saving information, due to their social expectations and Australia’s cultural acceptance of bullying. This led Rachel to developing Stymie – harm reporting without fear.</p>
  
      <p>Rachel was recognised for her work with young people at risk of harm, receiving the Queensland Australian of the Year Award in 2020 and she has an important message for educators…</p>
  
      <h2>Challenging Conversations and School Leadership</h2>
  
      <p>How can we challenge a conversation if we lack courage? Rachel believes this is a critical question, especially given recent revelations about sexual assault and issues of consent. She emphasizes the need for education leaders to address these issues.</p>
  
      <p>Rachel highlights the role of schools in addressing concerning societal issues that play out within their walls. She stresses the importance of empowering students to speak up and fostering a culture of openness.</p>
  
      <h2>Concerning Behaviors in 2021</h2>
  
      <p>The effects of COVID-19 have added complexities to school environments. Rachel discusses the challenges schools face in dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic, including increased lack of self-regulation and social integration issues.</p>
  
      <h2>Strategies for Addressing Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
  
      <p>Rachel acknowledges that addressing unacceptable behavior, abuse, and harm is difficult but crucial. She advocates for stronger connections between schools and parents and emphasizes the importance of mental health support.</p>
  
      <h2>Empowering Conversations through Courage</h2>
  
      <p>In her session ‘How can we challenge a conversation if we lack courage’ at the Leadership for Future Focused School conference, Rachel will delve into the coexistence of courage and fear. She encourages educators to step out of their comfort zones to address challenging issues.</p>
  
      <p>By empowering school leaders with the tools and mindset to tackle teen issues, Rachel aims to create safer and more supportive school environments.</p>

    tags: ['Education', 'Reading Strategies', 'Classroom Engagement'],
    keywords: 'whole-class reading, reading strategies, classroom engagement, comprehension, teaching techniques, literacy skills',
    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>After going out of fashion for a while at the expense of guided reading, whole-class reading seems to be back in favour again. Research points to a variety of benefits of whole-class reading. So, how do you make the most of whole-class reading sessions?</p>
      <p>Whole-class reading enables you to focus on more challenging texts. It also allows for better opportunities to engage pupils in class discussion. Furthermore, it makes the deeper exploration of a text more viable and manageable.</p>
      <p>However, you need to be careful with your strategies and approaches if you are to have a real impact on pupil learning with whole-class reading. Follow the following tips to plan whole-class reading activities that have a genuine impact.</p>
      <h2>Choose an appropriate text</h2>
      <p>If whole-class reading is to be effective, the choice of text is everything. It needs to be engaging, obviously. Furthermore, it needs to be totally fit for purpose and suited to the needs of the class. This means that the focus of the lesson should not be based on the text. Instead, focus on the learning needs of the class and choose an appropriate text to match this.</p>
      <h2>The importance of background and context</h2>
      <p>Regardless of the age of the children you are teaching, be aware of what you are ultimately working towards. The assessment criteria for GCSE English Literature leans heavily on the importance of context. What’s more, NFER (National Foundation for Educational Research) guidance stipulates that the most important aspect of language comprehension is background knowledge. Very often, it is the ‘missing link’ when it comes to pupil understanding.</p>
      <h2>Try to make reading a visual experience</h2>
      <p>There are several barriers to reading. Dyslexia is probably the most well-known but is far from the only hurdle that readers face. The inability to form mental images, aphantasia, is a condition that many children and adults suffer from. It often goes undiagnosed, and it can be extremely limiting for those it affects. This is why it is always useful to incorporate diagrams and pictures into the teaching of background, context, and vocabulary.</p>
      <p>This will be a great help for any children who find it difficult to visualize things. It will also be especially helpful for those who have never experienced the context of a text.</p>
      <h2>Read to the class</h2>
      <p>Although there are obvious benefits of children being given the opportunity to read out aloud, with whole-class reading, it is always best for the teacher to read to the class.</p>
      <p>The focus should be on comprehension rather than fluency. They are different skills, but poor fluency will only hamper comprehension. A teacher reading the text will be more fluent than a child. It will also make inference and understanding of emotions and feelings easier to pick up.</p>
      <h2>Mix up pupil activities</h2>
      <p>Reading a section of text followed by a set of comprehension questions is a tried and trusted approach. Of course, this strategy is not without merit or value. However, it can soon become very boring if this is always the pupil activity that follows on from a whole-class reading session.</p>
      <p>There are many different ways in which pupils can explore a text and show their understanding of characters’ feelings. Drama activities are particularly useful and engaging. Anything that breaks the repetitive cycle and the notion that the reading of a text is always followed by written answers to comprehension questions.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>In June, a sector-first research paper found that a “COVID hangover” continues to affect student and staff motivation, anxiety and engagement.</p>
      <p>According to the paper, the majority of the 74 independent school leaders and teachers who took part in the COVID-19 survey between March and April 2021, “felt that the remote learning period had a neutral or negative impact on students” with student wellbeing and social development more negatively impacted than academic progress.</p>
      <p>With schools in NSW and Queensland now dealing with a second wave of the COVID-19 virus and the lockdowns that ensued, there are renewed concerns that young people’s mental health may experience a further decline.</p>
      <h2>Kyllie Power: Leading Wellbeing at Iona College</h2>
      <p>Kyllie Power, Deputy Principal at Iona College in Geelong, has been an educator for more than 25 years, and over that time, has accumulated valuable experience about what works, and what doesn’t, in the all-important areas of social emotional learning and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>This is why in addition to being the school’s deputy principal, Power is also in charge of the school's culture and wellbeing programs – perhaps the most critical type of program in a school’s teaching and learning community.</p>
      <p>Power says recognising the needs of her school’s community and putting relationships at the heart of the school’s culture have been instrumental in the success of Iona College’s wellbeing program.</p>
      <blockquote>“Wellbeing can be successfully supported, and students can flourish when they are connected to caring adults,” Power told <em>The Educator</em>.</blockquote>
      <p>“At Iona we do not need to retrofit wellbeing into our practice, we can build it from the ground up.  We prioritise employing staff that share this vision and promote professional learning in this area both in the reactive interventions but importantly in the preventative science of wellbeing.”</p>
      <p>Power says a common shared language is vital as the school adopts a social emotional curriculum that is based on the best evidence-based practice.</p>
      <p>“Importantly, parents are our partners in this journey, and we share engaging at home learning opportunities via newsletters, parent partnership evenings and social media posts.”</p>
      <h2>Shifting the Paradigm: Preventative Wellbeing Measures</h2>
      <p>Power says there has been a shift away from the reactionary student welfare models of the past in favour of a more preventative, holistic approach.</p>
      <blockquote>“It is exciting to see the science of wellbeing evolving and that preventative measures can be embedded in a holistic way,” she said.</blockquote>
      <p>“No longer do we rely on the reactionary aspects that support our young people, we now balance the need for reaction with the teaching of explicit skills in social emotional learning.”</p>
      <p>Power says the term ‘soft skills’ is outdated and should be replaced with ‘essential skills’.</p>
      <blockquote>“All teachers and support staff at Iona are responsible for ensuring that we integrate this throughout the curriculum,” she said.</blockquote>
      <p>“This requires commitment from leadership in all areas of the College and a deep understanding of wellbeing science. Wellbeing is always on the agenda, staff PD is targeted and ongoing and help seeking is promoted to students by all staff.”</p>
      <h2>Utilizing Technology for Wellbeing</h2>
      <p>Power said using technology to assist the school’s students with help seeking and allowing real-time data to inform where supports need to be placed has been “a game changer.”</p>
      <blockquote>“Year Level Wellbeing leaders and student support staff monitor and use the data from our weekly ei Pulse check ins to ensure students who need help get it in a timely manner,” she said.</blockquote>
      <p>“Normalising the weekly check in and allowing staff time to analyse this data has meant our students feel supported and connected to staff.”</p>
      <p>Power said the regular check-ins allow relationships to strengthen and teachers feel supported when students need further help.</p>
      <blockquote>“As part of our weekly check ins ei Pulse randomises questions on key areas of the College allowing learning and wellbeing needs to be heard – a perfect example of student voice.”</blockquote>
      <h2>Whole-School Approach to Wellbeing</h2>
      <p>Dr Joe Thurbon, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Educator Impact said the company has been working very closely with schools that are looking to put in place an effective system for student wellbeing.</p>
      <blockquote>“It has become very clear that while individual teachers do an incredible job of supporting their students, supporting the whole-student truly is a whole-school effort,” Dr Thurbon told <em>The Educator</em>.</blockquote>
      <p>“Leaning on regular, frequent data truly transforms a school's approach to wellbeing. Iona College uses Educator Impact’s ei Pulse platform every Tuesday to receive updates on student well-being through short, 60 second check-ins.”</p>
      <p>Thurbon said the user-friendly colour-coded responses allow educators to intervene with students who may be struggling — and who otherwise wouldn’t have brought it to the staff’s attention.</p>
      <p>“Students also answer a handful of questions on their experience in school that provide great, actionable data to schools on a range of potential wellbeing and teaching and learning issues.”</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>New South Wales recently announced it would trial different start and finish times for various year levels in primary schools, aiming to alleviate traffic congestion and accommodate the needs of shift-working families.</p>
  
      <p>In Queensland, principals already have the option to stagger school days, offering flexibility such as starting classes at 9:30am and ending at 3:30pm. But how would this system operate, and is there evidence it could yield positive outcomes?</p>
  
      <h2>Teenagers need more sleep</h2>
      <p>Australia’s sleep guidelines recommend ample rest for children and teenagers, yet many fall short of the recommended hours. Lack of sleep can lead to cognitive and behavioral issues, impacting academic performance.</p>
  
      <p>A 2016 study highlighted the importance of sufficient sleep for students and supported the idea of delaying school start times to improve sleep quality.</p>
  
      <h2>What do we know about staggered school times?</h2>
      <p>While research in this area is limited, experiences from schools with nontraditional hours provide insights. For example, a Queensland study explored the effectiveness of split-shift timetables, revealing benefits such as reduced congestion, increased resource access, and better teaching blocks.</p>
  
      <h3>Benefits for students, staff, and communities</h3>
      <p>Staggered school hours offer various advantages, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced congestion and overcrowding</li>
        <li>Enhanced access to resources and staff</li>
        <li>Improved availability of specialist facilities</li>
        <li>Increased opportunities for part-time work and vocational training</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>For staff, the system allows for better teaching blocks, while parents benefit from improved transportation and access to teachers.</p>
  
      <h2>Addressing concerns and future considerations</h2>
      <p>Implementing staggered school times on a wider scale requires addressing logistical challenges and community concerns. Collaboration between the education department and local communities is essential to ensure a smooth transition.</p>
  
      <p>As New South Wales embarks on this trial, insights from other regions, such as the United States, where staggered start times have been successful, can inform decision-making.</p>
  
      <p>With ongoing research and community feedback, the trial in New South Wales has the potential to optimize school schedules for student well-being and community benefit.</p>

      <p>As mum Vanessa helps her 11-year-old daughter Talyah with her homework, the technology is at least familiar: a pen and paper.</p>
  
      <h2>Key Points:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>COVID-19 lockdowns have exposed the digital divide in education</li>
        <li>A Smith Family program is trying to bridge the divide by offering one-on-one teaching</li>
        <li>Some educators believe it is the future of learning</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>But for Talyah, it also creates a problem — much of the rest of her year six class is in a virtual classroom.</p>
  
      <blockquote>
        <p>"It is harder being away from the classroom because I don't have that many people to ask for help," Talyah said. "And I can't ask the teacher because I'm at home. I struggle because it's only me and my mum."</p>
      </blockquote>
  
      <p>Like an estimated 50 per cent of low-income families, Vanessa struggles to pay for internet, leaving her and Talyah with a phone which has poor reception at their home in Fairfield West in outer Sydney.</p>
  
      <p>"I've got a computer but it doesn't work because the dongle ran out of internet," Talyah said.</p>
  
      <p>Right across the country, it's a similar struggle. An estimated one in three Indigenous children do not have internet at home.</p>
  
      <p>But a program from The Smith Family — a program which Talyah is a part of — is trying to change that.</p>
  
      <h2>The Results Are In</h2>
      <p>The experiment found not only did the students stop falling further behind, but in literacy six out of 10 students caught up to or surpassed their classmates.</p>
  
      <p>"The program really helped them engage in their learning," Ms Hampshire said. "But really importantly, it showed that students were able to achieve greater progress than would be typically expected from average students over a six-month program."</p>
  
      <h2>Cheryl Giombi described the program as targeted individual learning.</h2>
      <p>Back in Fairfield West, Talyah said tutoring from the program meant she's wasn't as worried by the latest lockdown-induced disruption to learning.</p>
  
      <p>For Talyah it has also transformed reading and writing from a source of frustration to joy.</p>
  
      <p>Her current struggles are fuelling inspiration to share the transformative power of education.</p>
  
      <p>"I want to be a teacher when I grow up because I like helping students," Talyah said.</p>

        <p>Education leaders across NSW are facing significant challenges as they prepare for the return of staff and senior students to face-to-face learning amidst ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
  
        <p>Recently, concerns have escalated as several local government areas (LGAs) have been placed under lockdown due to the spread of the Delta variant. This has led to heightened anxieties among school communities.</p>
  
        <p>The decision to return to school has prompted calls for clear COVID-safe parameters from the NSW Government. Dr. Geoff Newcombe AM, Chief Executive of the Association of Independent Schools of NSW (AISNSW), emphasizes the need for flexibility, stating, "Independent school principals are experienced administrators who can develop COVID-safe plans tailored to their school's context."</p>
  
        <p>The safety of students and staff remains the top priority for education leaders. Craig Peterson, President of the NSW Secondary Principal’s Council, acknowledges the risks associated with returning to face-to-face learning and urges for caution.</p>
  
        <p>Special education principals, such as Matthew Johnson, President of the Australian Special Education Principals Association, highlight the unique challenges faced by students with complex needs during remote learning. Johnson stresses the importance of prioritizing vaccinations for vulnerable students and their families.</p>
  
        <p>Despite efforts to facilitate remote learning, the absence of in-person interaction poses significant challenges for students with disabilities. Johnson emphasizes the vital role schools play in providing support and routine for these students.</p>
  
        <p>The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic underscores the need for careful planning and collaboration within the education sector. Education leaders continue to navigate the complexities of ensuring a safe and effective learning environment for all students.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>With the emergence of more infectious variants of the COVID-19 virus, high school classrooms have mandated the wearing of masks for both teachers and students. This precaution was particularly stringent in Greater Sydney and all of Victoria, necessitating adherence even during in-person learning before the shift to remote education due to lockdowns.</p>
      
      <p>But what exactly constitutes the best practice for mask usage in the classroom? It's crucial to ensure that while masks are worn, they do not hinder the educational experience or have negative impacts on students.</p>
      
      <p>Dr. David Roy, a Lecturer in Education at the University of Newcastle, has extensively researched the efficacy of masks in educational environments. According to him, there's a widespread acknowledgment that masks play a vital role in preventing airborne infections, hence their necessity within classrooms.</p>
      
      <p>"There are multiple strategies to ensure the effectiveness of masks in the classroom," Dr. Roy explained. "This includes emphasizing facial expressions, using written instructions, and allowing teachers to remove masks when necessary for clear communication, especially for students who rely on lip-reading."</p>
      
      <p>Dr. Roy emphasized the importance of proper mask usage, stating, "A mask is only effective when it covers both the nose and mouth. It should only be handled from the edges, and sharing masks is strongly discouraged. Reusable masks should be washed daily, while single-use masks should be disposed of after a single use."</p>
      
      <p>Highlighting the vulnerability of young people to the Delta Variant, Dr. Roy stressed the significance of embracing masks as a protective measure. "Masks are one of our best forms of defense. Let's utilize every available measure to safeguard our students and staff," he concluded.</p>
      
      <p>Implementing these best practices not only ensures safety within high school classrooms but also promotes an environment conducive to effective learning amidst the ongoing challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>Year 12 students in Greater Sydney are facing a unique challenge as they prepare for their Higher School Certificate (HSC) amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With concerns escalating over the safety of students, the New South Wales government has announced a <strong>flexible school model</strong> aimed at ensuring essential education and wellbeing support for HSC students.</p>
  
    <p>Under this model, school assessments and trial exams will be completed at home, while access to schools will be limited to small groups of students at any given time starting from August 16th. The decision to implement this model reflects the government's commitment to prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of students in the face of the highly transmissible Delta strain.</p>
  
    <p>NSW Premier <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong> underscored the gravity of the situation, revealing alarming statistics of community transmission. With the number of cases expected to rise, the government is steadfast in its approach to follow health advice while ensuring that HSC students have access to essential education and support.</p>
  
    <p>Education Minister <strong>Sarah Mitchell</strong> emphasized the importance of providing HSC students with the necessary resources to navigate their final months of schooling. A comprehensive and flexible model will enable schools to deliver essential lessons and check-ins with teachers in a safe and sensible manner.</p>
  
    <p>However, students residing in the eight local government areas (LGAs) of concern, including Blacktown, Campbelltown, and Fairfield, will not return to school yet. This cautious approach aims to mitigate the risk of further transmission in high-risk areas.</p>
  
    <p>Efforts are underway to facilitate the vaccination of students in these areas, with Premier Berejiklian announcing eligibility for vaccination starting August 9th. Additionally, discussions are ongoing between school principals, teachers, and relevant authorities to explore all available options to safeguard the health and safety of the school community.</p>
  
    <p>The <strong>NSW Teachers Federation</strong> has raised concerns about the safety of reopening schools, citing the potential risks associated with human interaction in school settings. A special Executive meeting will convene to address these concerns and determine appropriate measures to ensure the safety of students and staff.</p>
  
    <p>In conclusion, the introduction of a flexible school model underscores the government's commitment to prioritizing the safety and wellbeing of Year 12 students. By adapting to the evolving challenges posed by the pandemic, educators and policymakers are working tirelessly to provide students with the support they need to succeed in their academic endeavors.</p>

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>The recent extension of remote learning in NSW has stirred anxiety among parents, students, and teachers across Sydney, reminiscent of the challenges faced during the 2020 lockdown. Lisa Gerrard, Principal of St Bernadette’s Primary Dundas Valley, reflects on the parallels between last year's experiences and the current situation as NSW confronts its second wave of COVID-19.</p>
  
    <p>“In 2020, transitioning from face-to-face to digital learning in a short span demanded meticulous planning,” Gerrard recalls. “We ensured staff were proficient in technology use, established clear guidelines, and maintained consistency in delivery.”</p>
  
    <p>Addressing the challenge of equitable access, Gerrard explains, “Not all families had devices, so we provided loan devices and implemented rosters for onsite learning, particularly for Defence families and essential workers.”</p>
  
    <p>Many positive changes from 2020 persisted even as face-to-face classes resumed, enabling schools like St Bernadette’s to manage the current lockdown effectively. Gerrard emphasizes the importance of staying connected with students, ensuring their well-being and engagement.</p>
  
    <p>Reflecting on her leadership approach, Gerrard underscores flexibility and being a source of calm for the community. “Active listening was crucial. When someone needed my attention, they had it,” she affirms.</p>
  
    <p>Gerrard commends her staff for their dedication during the 2020 lockdown and stresses the significance of trust and collaboration in overcoming challenges. “Their commitment to the children was unparalleled,” she acknowledges.</p>

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>Victoria's Premier Dan Andrews has announced a seven-day lockdown following the detection of 8 additional cases of the Delta strain.</p>
    
    <p>The decision entails students statewide transitioning to remote learning until 12 August.</p>
    
    <p>“There is no alternative but for us to listen to our public health experts and take their advice, and that advice is to lockdown for seven days from 8pm tonight,” Premier Andrews stated.</p>
    
    <p>“Only three of the new cases can be linked to a new outbreak. The rest, we will have to assume are mystery cases. We don’t know who they’ve given it to, or how many people they’ve given it to.”</p>
    
    <p>The Premier emphasized the urgency of the situation, suggesting that residents should treat the lockdown as "effective immediately."</p>
    
    <p>“My fear is that if we were to wait even just a few days longer, there’s every chance that, instead of being locked down for a week, we would be locked down until we’re all vaccinated – and that could be months away.”</p>
    
    <p>Earlier today, it was announced that Al-Taqwa College, the largest Islamic college in Victoria, would be closed for 14 days due to a teacher contracting the highly contagious Delta strain.</p>
    
    <p>Health officials have raised concerns about potential transmission, as the infected teacher may have been unknowingly infectious for several days while teaching at the school.</p>
    
    <p>Two other schools, Ilim College and the Australian International Academy of Education (AIAE), have closed some of their campuses as a precautionary measure.</p>
    
    <p>This morning, Victorian Health confirmed more than a dozen new exposure sites across the west, including in Caroline Springs, Altona North, and Spotswood.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>COVID-19 has become the latest issue where school leaders can be thrust into the national media spotlight without warning. Few are ready for this and the stress of reporters swarming around the school and demanding interviews significantly adds to an already serious situation.</p>
      <p>What’s the answer?</p>
      <p>There are two things every school needs in place as an insurance policy against this happening. First, they need a basic Crisis Communication Plan that outlines exactly what to do if this does eventuate. More on that shortly. Second, they need two spokespeople who know how to talk to media. Not just those who are good communicators, but those who understand how a media interview is quite unlike any other conversation and how to master it.</p>
      <p>This is not rocket science and doesn’t take long to sort, but many schools and school leaders have been caught without anything in place. This damages their reputations and those of their schools.</p>
      <p>I have heard some school leaders say that the media can just wait, but that doesn’t work in this age of 24/7 news and social media. If a school doesn’t communicate quickly and effectively with both its own community and the media, it will be made out to be a villain rather than a victim because it appears that they either don’t care or don’t know what is going on. They pay a heavy price for this on social and traditional media where others start to speculate about what is happening and emotional parents are only too willing to share their views through their own channels and by talking with reporters.</p>
      <h2>What should the Crisis Communication Plan have in it?</h2>
      <p>The first thing the plan needs is what are called holding statements. These are short media releases that say very little, but let your community and media know that you are aware of the situation and are doing all that you can to resolve it, or support those affected. That lets your community know you are in control and means you will feature in early news stories about the issue. The alternative is a line in news stories saying, ‘the school refused to comment,’ which is never a good look and suggests you are hiding something. Those stories then make their way into social media where people comment on them.</p>
      <p>Second, there are various roles that need to be filled. Someone has to lead the communication response, and this is unlikely to be the principal because he/she will be too busy doing other tasks. If you have a communications team, the leader of that would hold this position, otherwise a DP or AP is usually the best person.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson position is usually held by the Principal, possibly in conjunction with the Board Chair. It’s best to use only one if possible, but sometimes both will be needed. The Online Manager is another vital role. This involves monitoring social media, and not just the school sites. There will be times when misinformation must be corrected, and messages shared with the community.</p>
      <p>The plan also needs contact information for multiple people, different channels to communicate with them, while a number of places need to be organised to accommodate different groups when a negative issue strikes. For example, where to put reporters when they arrive at school. You don’t want them hanging around reception or outside the gate where they will try to talk to emotional parents and staff.</p>
      <p>While there is more to a School Crisis Communication Plan than can be explained in this article, it’s not difficult to prepare and doesn’t have to take long. However, it does need to be done because there’s nothing more stressful for a school leadership team than dealing with an issue like this without a plan of action. It’s too late to plan once something happens.</p>
      <h2>Media interview skills</h2>
      <p>The other thing a school needs are trained media spokespeople. That’s because there will be times when a school needs to front up to media. Often a statement will work at the initial stage, but later media will demand to talk. It’s usually best to agree to this because it gives you the power to control the story, rather than leave that to others who may not be sympathetic or communicate misinformation.</p>
      <p>With most media interviews, reporters only use snippets of your conversation. That’s why you need a clear message and the skills to return to it regularly. You also need to know how to package your message in media friendly ways. By doing this, you have far more control over what they focus on in their stories than you may believe. Your message is likely to focus on empathy for victims and what you are doing to help them.</p>
      <p>By being ready with a plan and media trained spokespeople, you can turn a negative issue into one that will grow your reputation by showing you care and are doing everything you can to help. That’s all most people want to hear in situations like a COVID-19 case or any other issue where there are victims. But failing to do this quickly and being unaware of the traps, the opposite often happens.</p>

      <p>An urgent meeting of all principals and NSW Teachers Federation representatives at high schools in the greater Sydney area has been called for tomorrow after Premier Gladys Berejiklian said Year 12 students would return to school on 16 August, despite the state’s escalating COVID-19 situation.</p>
  
      <p>This morning, NSW Health confirmed there were 262 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm last night and five deaths, marking the state’s worst day of the outbreak so far.</p>
  
      <p>Unlike the previous strain of COVID-19, the Delta strain is infecting a large number of young people. More than 70% of the state’s total cases are aged under 40, and this week a Sydney man in his 20s died from the virus.</p>
  
      <p>Three students at two schools on the NSW Central Coast-Lake Macquarie border have tested positive to the highly contagious Delta strain of COVID-19, forcing two schools to close for deep cleaning and contact tracing.</p>
  
      <p>Today, the teachers union said a special meeting of principals and NSWTF representatives, to be held Friday, 6 August, at 1pm, would consider “all options available” to protect the health and safety of teachers, students and school communities “should the Premier fail to heed the evidence” and proceed with the announced return to face-to-face teaching of year 12 on 16 August.</p>
  
      <p>“The Premier’s decision represents a staggering disregard for the teaching service and the school communities we serve,” NSWTF president, Angelo Gavrielatos, said.</p>
  
      <p>“This announcement, made through the media and without any prior consultation with the profession, highlights the Government’s disrespect for the work of teachers and principals and the complex operations of schools.”</p>
  
      <p>Gavrielatos added that the Premier’s announcement was “political” and “defies health advice.”</p>
  
      <p>“The advice of the Chief Health Officer could not be clearer; worksites and human interaction are the main contributors in the transmission of this dangerous strain of COVID-19. Schools are worksites and human interaction is our business,” he said.</p>
  
      <p>“A special Executive meeting of Federation on 10 August will decide on further action in relation to this matter.”</p>
  
      <p>Gavrielatos said that while the return of Year 12 might represent an aspirational target for the Government, the "national emergency" of high case numbers, including those circulating in the community while infectious, and tightening restrictions, cannot be ignored.</p>
  
      <p>“You are rightly outraged by last Wednesday’s announcement. Federation has made this clear to the Government in the strongest terms,” he said.</p>
  
      <p>“We continue to call on the Government for consistency in the application of health advice and restrictions across ALL settings, including schools, in affected areas. We continue to call for the prioritisation of ALL teachers in the ongoing vaccination roll out.”</p>

      <p>As we cautiously emerge from lockdown restrictions, many are contemplating the impact of what became the 'new normal' during the pandemic. Among these adaptations, home-working and home-schooling have been prominent features. A recent survey by Ipsos MORI sheds light on parental perspectives regarding home-schooling during the last lockdown.</p>
  
      <h2>Positive Perceptions, Yet Disparities Persist</h2>
  
      <p>According to the Ipsos MORI survey, approximately two-thirds of parents viewed home-schooling during the last lockdown as successful. However, a deeper dive into the data unveils troubling trends. Parents from lower-income backgrounds, residing in deprived areas, and those with larger families were notably less likely to report positive experiences with home-schooling.</p>
  
      <h2>Challenges Faced by Some Families</h2>
  
      <p>For a quarter of parents, home-schooling proved challenging. This statistic becomes more concerning when considering the disproportionate burden borne by economically disadvantaged families. The digital divide exacerbates the situation, with access to suitable learning environments and necessary technology posing significant obstacles.</p>
  
      <p>Over time, home-schooling may have become more manageable for some families as they adapted to the new routines. However, students with diverse learning needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds continued to face significant hurdles. The poll highlights a correlation between parental earnings and the ease of adapting to remote learning.</p>
  
      <h2>The Widening Educational Gap</h2>
  
      <p>The Ipsos MORI findings underscore existing concerns about the growing educational divide. Families with ample resources find home-schooling a feasible alternative to traditional classroom learning, at least temporarily. Conversely, economically disadvantaged households face mounting challenges, potentially widening the gap in academic achievement.</p>
  
      <p>Addressing these disparities necessitates comprehensive support mechanisms to ensure all children have equitable access to education, regardless of socioeconomic status.</p>
  
      <p>Ultimately, the Ipsos MORI poll underscores the urgent need to address the impact of the pandemic on education and to implement strategies aimed at narrowing the educational gap.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>Amidst discussions about how to support students in catching up on lost education due to the pandemic, it's becoming clear that not all proposed solutions are met with enthusiasm from parents.</p>
      <p>A recent poll by Ipsos Mori sheds light on parental preferences. Only one in five parents show a preference for longer school days, and just one in four see shorter school holidays as a viable option for catching up.</p>
      <p>Instead, parents are more inclined towards solutions that prioritize mental health and academic support for their children. This indicates a significant divergence from the views of the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, who has advocated for shorter holidays and longer school days.</p>
      <h2>Parental Concerns Over Longer School Days</h2>
      <p>Parents seem unimpressed with the notion of extending school days. With only 21% in favor of the idea, and merely 27% supporting shorter holidays, it's evident that most parents don't perceive these measures as beneficial for their children's well-being.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, there's a disparity between parental views and those of the general public. While 43% of the general public believe in the effectiveness of longer school days, only 37% of parents share this sentiment. Similarly, opinions diverge on shorter summer holidays.</p>
      <h2>The Toll on Teachers</h2>
      <p>Extending the school day or reducing holidays could exacerbate the strain on teachers. With educators already at risk of burnout, such measures could worsen the situation, leaving them with inadequate time for rest and preparation.</p>
      <p>Moreover, additional lessons delivered by fatigued teachers to weary students may not yield the desired results. This could ultimately be counterproductive, hindering both teacher and student well-being.</p>
      <h2>The Case for Well-Deserved Breaks</h2>
      <p>Teachers and students alike benefit from the rejuvenating break that the summer holiday provides. It allows them to return to school refreshed and ready for the new academic year.</p>
      <p>Instead of doubling down on more classroom time, it might be prudent to consider alternative approaches that prioritize holistic student well-being while addressing educational gaps.</p>

      <p>With Sydney schools moving to home learning once again, and COVID-19’s highly contagious Delta strain making the possibility of other states following in the coming weeks, jaded teachers must adapt their lessons for online delivery. For many teachers, this means juggling classrooms with educating their own children at home.</p>
      <p>From my experience working on both sides of the distance education (DE) fence – as a DE teacher at Australian Christian College and helping my son complete school online – here’s some tips for making a successful transition.</p>
      <h2>In your role as a teacher</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Be explicit</h3>
          <p>When you’ve been teaching for a while, it’s easy to take your knowledge for granted. But the people supervising children’s learning at home don’t have an education degree or years of teaching experience. Without your help, they’re relying on what they know from experiences with their own children or talking to others in similar circumstances.</p>
          <!-- Additional content omitted for brevity -->
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>For supervising your own children</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Ensure good supervision</h3>
          <p>Like many 17-year-olds, our son can find things he enjoys doing more than schoolwork! One of our conditions is that he does schoolwork in his dad’s office so we can monitor his screen. On the days I work from home, he works in his dad’s office in the morning, and does the second half of his day at the table where I’m working. We don’t allow schoolwork to be done in his bedroom, because we know he would get off task.</p>

  <article class="blog-content">
    Last year, a team of nine educators from Australia, New Zealand, the US, and Singapore, led by Associate Professor Louise Phillips from James Cook University, conducted an international qualitative study of 635 teachers.
  
    The survey, which opened in May, asked teachers how COVID-19 affected them and their students. Interestingly, of the 179 Australian respondents, 65% had over 21 years of teaching experience, but less than 10% had experience teaching online.
  
    Dr. Melissa Cain, lecturer of Inclusive Education at the Australian Catholic University’s National School of Education, noted that the immediacy of the switch to online learning initially overwhelmed many teachers.
  
    “A significant increase in their workload as well as a scramble to obtain technology access and the skills to use new apps and programs was noted,” Dr. Cain told The Educator.
  
    “The production and delivery of online teaching and learning materials was a challenge without adequate training and resourcing.”
  
    Dr. Cain highlighted two major themes from the study: technology and relationships.
  
    “Teachers underestimated their new role as a counsellor for anxious students and parents, especially parents of students with special needs.”
  
    One respondent expressed, ‘Not only had I very little experience with distance learning, but also little interest. I treasure face-to-face contact as I believe that teaching is about relationships, and it is far more difficult to establish relationships in an online environment.’
  
    Dr. Cain pointed out the silver lining, noting that many parents gained a better understanding of their child's learning process and the importance of teachers' roles.
  
    “On reflection, while the swift change to online learning was stressful and taxing in many ways, and that the vast majority of teachers prefer face-to-face teaching, it is clear that Australian teachers are resilient, creative, and dedicated to their profession,” she said.
  
    “They proved they are adaptive under extreme pressure.”
  
    Looking ahead, Dr. Cain believes teachers will be better prepared for potential future shifts to online learning.
  
    “Should online learning be needed again in 2021, teachers will be better equipped with technological requirements and will prioritize personal connections with students and parents, demonstrating more patience, kindness, and empathy.”
  
    “They will be more flexible with content presentation and requests for extensions on assessment. They will know where and who to turn to for advice and utilize each other for support”.

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>It's estimated that dyslexia affects approximately one-in-five Australians, spanning from mild to severe cases, as reported by the Australian Dyslexia Association (ADA). In educational assessments, terms like SLD (Specific/Significant Learning Difficulty/Disability) or LD (Learning Difficulty) are often used interchangeably in Australia, encompassing reading challenges, which may or may not indicate dyslexia.</p>
    <p>Diagnosed cases of dyslexia are generally categorized into six types: phonological, surface, visual, primary, secondary/developmental, and trauma dyslexia. This disorder is recognized under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and by the Human Rights Commission in Australia.</p>
    <p>Dyslexia typically manifests during early schooling years, with affected children showing difficulty in reading despite their inherent capabilities. Undiagnosed dyslexia can lead to frustration, low self-esteem, loss of motivation, and social-emotional issues.</p>
    <p>Research reveals a concerning lack of dyslexia training among teachers, both in the UK and Australia. Addressing this, the ADA emphasizes the importance of recognizing dyslexia's common characteristics and taking proactive steps to support affected students.</p>
    <p>If educators suspect a child may be dyslexic, open communication with parents and guardians is vital. The ADA recommends thorough assessments to understand the student's needs better and provide personalized support.</p>
    <p>Once diagnosed, teachers can implement various strategies to assist dyslexic students effectively. These include exposure to written material, using appropriate fonts and paper colors, and encouraging physical writing alongside digital learning.</p>
    <p>Early intervention is crucial, as delayed diagnosis significantly impacts a child's learning trajectory. Teachers play a pivotal role in reducing the negative effects of delayed diagnosis by acting swiftly and decisively.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, dyslexia requires nuanced understanding and proactive support from educators. By adopting informed strategies, teachers can empower dyslexic students to thrive academically and emotionally.</p>

    <article class="blog-content">
      <p>During times of change, challenges often arise. Last year, the education sector faced a monumental shift, requiring schools, universities, and other institutions to completely reimagine how learning was delivered. Steven Fouracre, Assistant Principal at Wodonga Middle Years College, aptly summarized the situation, stating, "We were forced into a situation where we had to enable 900 students to learn remotely, it was unprecedented and we relied heavily on our LMS to make the transition. It’s the first time in more than 150 years education has been delivered differently in Australia."</p>
      <p>To delve deeper into the impact of this transition, we surveyed over 200 Australian students across different education levels. The insights we gathered shed light on the challenges students faced and the strategies educators can employ to support them.</p>
      <h2>Difficulty Staying Focused and Motivated to Learn – 53%</h2>
      <p>One of the most prevalent challenges reported by students was the struggle to stay focused and motivated while learning remotely. With numerous distractions at home and the blurring of boundaries between home and school, engaging students became paramount.</p>
      <p>To address this, educators must rethink their pedagogical approaches. Passive learning methods no longer suffice in the digital realm. Providing dynamic learning materials, especially through video formats, and offering frequent feedback are crucial. Additionally, fostering peer discussions encourages collaboration and higher-order thinking.</p>
      <h2>Enabling Teachers and Lecturers to Use Technology Effectively – 39%</h2>
      <p>Transitioning to remote teaching was equally challenging for educators. Many were accustomed to traditional face-to-face instruction and had to quickly adapt to digital platforms. To facilitate this transition, professional development is essential.</p>
      <p>Teachers need support to utilize digital tools effectively, from hosting online lectures to moderating discussion forums. Delivering professional development via the same LMS used for teaching allows educators to familiarize themselves with the platform and empathize with their students' experience.</p>
      <h2>Issues with Internet Connection – 38%</h2>
      <p>Another significant challenge was the disparity in internet access among students. This digital divide impacted the learning experience for many.</p>
      <p>Addressing this issue requires a multifaceted approach. Providing content in various formats, prioritizing low-bandwidth options, and accommodating on-campus learning for students with limited connectivity are essential steps.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, maintaining student engagement is paramount in remote learning. Educators must be empowered to navigate this new educational landscape while ensuring equitable access for all students.</p>

    <article class="blog-content">
      <p>Research has revealed the profound impact of mindfulness practices on enhancing the mental health and overall wellbeing of young people, fostering positive relationships, managing emotions, and breaking free from negative habits.</p>
      
      <p>However, the benefits of mindfulness extend beyond students. Renowned performance coach Dr. Adam Fraser's studies have uncovered extensive advantages for school staff.</p>
      
      <p>In 2018, Berry Public School principal Bob Willetts, recognizing the escalating mental health challenges faced by Australia's school leaders, collaborated with Dr. Fraser to launch the Flourish Movement. This initiative aimed to address these pressing issues through mindfulness-based approaches.</p>
      
      <p>Deakin University's research highlights the significant improvements brought about by the 'Flourish' program, including a 91% increase in boundary strength, a 50% rise in strategic time allocation, and a 20% decrease in stress levels.</p>
      
      <p>Despite the immense challenges posed by the transition to remote learning in 2020, schools have shown remarkable resilience and progress in adopting hybrid learning models.</p>
      
      <p>Bob Willetts expressed optimism about the current state of affairs, noting a more settled atmosphere for NSW leaders compared to the previous year. He emphasized the importance of face-to-face interactions and professional development activities in fostering collegial support.</p>
      
      <p>While mindfulness can significantly benefit school leaders' health, wellbeing, focus, and cognition, Willetts cautioned against viewing it as a cure-all solution. He emphasized the need for a holistic approach to wellbeing that encompasses various aspects of recovery and stress management.</p>
      
      <p>Participants in Flourish workshops have reported a 'ripple effect' where improvements in one aspect of wellbeing positively influence others. Mindfulness strategies, ranging from formal programs to informal practices like surfing, have shown promising results.</p>
      
      <p>For Willetts, surfing serves as a personal mindfulness strategy, facilitating a state of stillness, presence, and heightened awareness of his physical and emotional state.</p>
      
      <p>Overall, the integration of mindfulness practices in schools represents a proactive step towards enhancing the mental health and wellbeing of both students and staff, fostering resilience in the face of challenges.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>The role of parents as partners in their child’s learning journey is a critical one that has been proven by over five decades of research in having a critical impact on student learning and achievement.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the Review to Achieve Educational Excellence in Australian Schools, popularly known as the Gonski 2.0 report, debunked the belief that schools are solely responsible for children’s education.</p>
      <p>Dr Amy Graham is an education expert at UNSW with a strong interest in education psychology, policy, and transitions to school. Her PhD thesis is on how parents can prepare their children to succeed at school – a critical question as Term 1 begins.</p>
      <p>"Parents are a child’s first and most influential teachers," Dr Graham said.</p>
      <p>"Parents teach young children all about the world when they are young, and this does not stop once children enter the school gate”.</p>
      <p>Dr Graham says parents still have the potential to affect their child’s educational potential and love of learning.</p>
      <p>“This can be through providing a stimulating and fun home learning environment, their communication of high expectations, facilitating positive conversations about school, and showing interest in their child’s learning and interests,” she said.</p>
      <p>"Showing an interest is one of the simplest ways to help a child be successful”.</p>
      <p>Dr Graham’s research, recently highlighted in an article by the Media Centre for Education Research Australia (MCERA), showed that parents are keen to share this responsibility with teachers and create a partnership between home and school, but might need support from teachers to find ways to join in their child’s learning journey.</p>
      <p>"For some parents, it is hard to know where to start if they have not experienced positive examples themselves or struggled at school,” she said.</p>
      <p>“But it is important for parents to know their efforts can make a massive difference to their child’s educational success – even more than where they send them to school or how much they earn. They just have to show an interest”.</p>
      <h2>Opportunities for school-parent ties</h2>
      <p>Some school leaders say the COVID-19 pandemic has provided some important lessons for schools in the context of parent-teacher ties.</p>
      <p>Carey Baptist Grammar School principal, Jonathan Walter, says the pandemic provided a unique opportunity for parents to see and appreciate the true extent of what teachers do on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>“For the first time, parents – particularly in the younger years – have essentially been in the classroom with their children,” Walter told The Educator.</p>
      <p>“They’ve seen first-hand the enormous effort our teachers have made to connect and to support the learning of their children. We received a lot of feedback and I think parents have developed an appreciation for the great work that our staff do”.</p>
      <p>Walter said parents valued the teachers’ patience, their ability to explain concepts and their efforts in working with the different types of support each student needs.</p>
      <p>“I think, moving forward, this relationship allows us opportunities to draw on the expertise of our parents in their professions, to really extend Carey’s offering beyond the traditional boundaries of the School,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The ability to tap into what is a hugely creative and expert group of parents and for our students learn from their real-world experiences will deepen the program and make it richer for everyone”.</p>

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>Next year, a cohort of Fremantle students will be the first to experience a revolutionary new educational model being dubbed “an exciting alternative to mainstream schooling”. With no bell, classroom, timetable, or set study times, this unconventional approach to education promises to shake things up.</p>
  
    <p>All Saints’ College, through its Djoowak, The Beyond Boundaries Institute, has been developing a range of innovative programs, alongside and in partnership with educational innovators such as Professor Yong Zhao, Jan Owen AM, and others in business, industry, and higher education who form the College’s Beyond Boundaries Advisory Group.</p>
  
    <p>An exciting extension of this work is The Studio School (TSS), which will allow Year 10-12 students to combine their studies with authentic and purposeful projects in partnership with industry mentors while also achieving their final school certificate and ATAR.</p>
  
    <p>This personalized “studio” model of education will see students combine their studies with authentic and purposeful projects in partnership with industry mentors – but at a pace, and at a time, of their own choosing.</p>
  
    <h2>Breaking Down the Walls of Traditional Education</h2>
  
    <p>Esther Hill, the Director of Djoowak: The Beyond Boundaries Institute and Dean of Teaching and Learning at All Saints’ College, emphasized that TSS builds on the key notions of personalizing learning and connecting students with the ‘real world’ through authentic learning opportunities.</p>
  
    <p>“TSS draws on the wisdom and experience of the studio model in its various iterations - from High Tech High to NuVu and to the Studio School movement in the UK - and develops this model in the specific context of Western Australia and its relatively rigidly structured senior secondary curriculum,” Hill explained.</p>
  
    <p>Hill further elaborated, “At its heart, the experience of being a student or a learning mentor at TSS feels very different from the traditional model of school. Imagine a co-working space for students, learning mentors, and facilitators. Rather than having break-out spaces in the open plan, flexible spaces, you have break-in spaces where, at point of need, lessons can be conducted or meetings can be had.”</p>
  
    <h2>Engaging with the Community</h2>
  
    <p>The Studio School is situated in the vibrant, eclectic CBD of the port city of Fremantle, integrated into the daily life of the city. Hill describes the school as a part of the community, with TSS students connecting and working with local businesses, industry, and the people of Fremantle and its surrounds.</p>
  
    <p>“Rather than being kept out of the school buildings, the community is invited in,” Hill emphasized.</p>
  
    <p>During the day, supported by the learning mentors at TSS, students map their learning goals, tasks, and outcomes, engaging in a variety of activities including completing online courses, collaborating with peers, attending classes, meeting with project mentors, and pursuing offsite projects or courses.</p>
  
    <h2>Addressing Educational Challenges</h2>
  
    <p>Peter Allen, vice principal at All Saints’ College, highlighted the need for educational reform to better prepare students for the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world. He emphasized the importance of stronger connections between schooling and the world of work, as well as the development of enterprise skills.</p>
  
    <p>Allen underscored the significance of mentoring at TSS, where students engage in real-world projects supported by mentors from various industries. This approach, he explained, provides students with practical learning experiences and fosters connections with relevant professionals.</p>
  
    <h2>Transforming Education</h2>
  
    <p>The Studio School’s model challenges traditional education on multiple fronts, including the physical learning environment, curriculum design, mentorship approach, and assessment methods. By emphasizing personalized learning, real-world engagement, and holistic skill development, TSS aims to redefine success beyond conventional metrics like ATAR scores.</p>
  
    <p>Allen concluded, “Success is measured through the growth and development of broader capabilities such as collaboration, organization, critical and creative thinking within the context of authentic projects, providing students with real and meaningful learning experiences.”</p>

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>Have you got an easy-to-read, well-written, results-orientated CV which still isn’t winning you a face-to-face interview? The problem is, that when it comes to sought-after roles, most serious candidates will have followed those very same principles. So how are you meant to make your CV stand out in a 100-deep pile of perfectly presented documents?</p>
  
    <p>Well, succeeding in winning an interview for your dream role means staying ahead of the curve and following the latest industry trends closely. Here are four major CV trends to seize upon, to get your CV ready for 2021… and beyond!</p>
  
    <h2>1. Video CVs</h2>
    <p>It’s 2021… who says your CV can only be a paper or PDF document? After sifting through a pile of predictable black and white papers, a CV which incorporates video is a sure fire way to grab a recruiter’s attention. No, you don’t have to list your entire work history and education in your video. Aim to create a short, snappy and engaging one to three minute video which will work alongside your original document. You could even add a QR code to your CV to make the video easily accessible to employers. Think of it as a video version of your personal profile. It should communicate to potential employers why you’re the right person for the job. It should also highlight your most impressive skills and achievements. Your confidence, personality and passion will shine through way more on a video than through text, so it’s well worth the extra time and effort. Don’t forget to dress professionally and find an appropriate background, such as your home office – recruiters don’t want to see your dirty laundry!</p>
  
    <h2>2. Personal blogs</h2>
    <p>Blogging isn’t just a hobby – it’s also a great way to show off your writing and digital skills to potential employers. Recruiters want to see candidates who are creative and passionate outside of the office walls. So if you’re not yet doing so, make it your New Year’s resolution, as there can be many benefits to blogging. You could start a blog with topics or opinion pieces related to your professional industry to prove your interest and depth of knowledge. But what if your blog isn’t relevant to the role you’re applying to? Well, a well-designed website full of perfectly-written, traffic-worthy SEO-optimised blogs displays some great, ultra-current, transferable skills anyway. Make sure to include it in your CV.</p>
  
    <h2>3. YouTube channels</h2>
    <p>Content creation is one of the most in-demand skills right now. So, if you’ve got a successful YouTube channel, you should definitely brag about it on your CV. Having the courage and passion to put yourself out there and build a community of followers is sure to impress recruiters. Plus, if you’ve garnered a following, you’ve probably developed some fantastic skills, too. Think video production, editing, design, public speaking, social media management and marketing. If you do decide to list your YouTube channel on your CV, make sure all the videos on your channel are appropriate for potential employers to see.</p>
  
    <h2>4. Side hustles</h2>
    <p>Nowadays, it’s normal for talented self-starters to have a successful side hustle alongside their full or part-time job. People often leave side-projects out of their CV. This is because they fear appearing like they have ‘eggs in too many baskets’ or that it somehow appears disloyal. But this couldn’t be further from the truth! Showing that you’re an entrepreneur with the initiative and commitment to juggle multiple projects and earn money off your own back is sure to command attention. Make it clear that your side hustle has shaped you into a fantastic multi-tasker with a varied range of professional and business skills. Don’t forget to quantify your side-hustle achievements, too. If you made extra income by writing blogs for a local business, by how much did this boost their website traffic? Maybe you have an online business designing flyers or brochures – did these help your clients to gain more leads or make sales? Focusing on results proves your impact to potential employers.</p>
  
    <p>Take these CV trends on board! If you want to get in the job hunting game in 2020 and beyond, may sure you keep up with these CV trends – good luck!</p>

      <li><strong>Grading discretion:</strong> Saying something is graded when you never plan to look at it again.</li>
      <li><strong>Seating chart puzzles:</strong> Crafting the perfect seating arrangement to minimize distractions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Teaching is full of unexpected challenges and delightful surprises. While college equips you with the basics, it's the day-to-day experiences in the classroom that truly shape you into a seasoned educator.</p>
    <p>So, to all the future teachers out there, buckle up and get ready for the wild ride ahead!</p>

      <article class="blog-content">
        <p>Take a look at the astounding results of our debut health and wellbeing survey!</p>
        
        <h2>The Results – Australian Teachers’ Health and Wellbeing</h2>
        <p>An astounding 670 Australian teachers responded to our survey! We were so grateful that the Australian teaching community helped share our survey and encouraged others to take part. As a result, we have been able to gather a huge amount of helpful and critical information around the topic of teacher health and wellbeing. So, thank you to each and every one of you who helped us spread the word.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, the respondents to the survey were typical of the populated areas. Almost half of the respondents had less than 5 years teaching experience. Respondents by year level were fairly even across the board.</p>
        
        <h3>Average Hours Worked by Teachers</h3>
        <p>A huge 76% of respondents said that they work an average of 40+ hours a week. What’s more, 31% said they work greater than 50 hours in any given week. So much for working 9-3 hey?</p>
        
        <p>We found it interesting that 35% of survey respondents indicated that ‘society’s perception of teachers’ was a major pain point for them. There’s no doubt that as teachers we receive the usual remarks about our 9-3 work hours and how lucky we are to have ALL of those school holidays. Well, the working hours statistic proves (not that we didn’t already know it) how crucial these school holidays are for our teachers to recuperate and recharge? You guys are a dedicated and inspirational bunch! You deserve the holiday breaks – enjoy!</p>
        
        <p>We truly think you are incredible. Check out why in our blog – Teachers| 20 Reasons Why You Are Incredible.</p>
        
        <h3>How Are Australian Teachers Feeling?</h3>
        <p>Surprisingly, even though this survey was completed during a typically stressful time (Term 4, report card writing), 54% of respondents rated their wellbeing 6 or higher on a scale of 1-10. As you can see, teachers are still maintaining a positive vibe and we hope this increases during the Christmas holidays.</p>
        
        <p>It’s true, it often feels like time speeds up over the holidays. However, with some planning, it’s easy to make the most of your precious time off. For hints and tips, read this fantastic blog – Teacher’s School Holiday To-Do List.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Factors Impacting Teachers’ Wellbeing</h3>
        <p>We classified the responses into two groups. This enabled us to get a greater understanding of the key factors that led to a positive or not so positive year. The results showed that a school-led wellbeing initiative program had a large impact on the school year for both groups. Overall, 33% of our satisfied respondents noted they had access to school-led wellbeing initiatives and felt supported in their role.</p>
        
        <h3>Teaching Highlights From 2019</h3>

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>Before 2020, online or virtual learning was a somewhat unfamiliar practice, used mainly by a select few: Master's students, ill or traveling students, homeschooled kids, or for the occasional international short course. Now, everyone has a taste of virtual learning and is trying to work through the transition as best they can.</p>
    <p>Educators have a particularly challenging hurdle to overcome in this transition, keeping students engaged in virtual meetings. Instructors are used to walking through the classroom and keeping their students' attention by interacting with them in person. With this mostly changed, you can lose a lot when switching from the school setting to a virtual one. Going through the lesson plan virtually can result in a cold, boring class. It lowers engagement, cuts enthusiasm, and affects student-teacher relationships.</p>
    <p>So how do we avoid this awkward virtual learning experience? We add engaging activities. Fortunately, there are many options for activities you can add to a virtual class. We'll go through a few of them below.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Incorporate Current Events</strong>: While this may not work well for very young students, it works excellently for Grades 4 and up. Current events don't have to be political unless it's a history class. It can be what's happening in the local community, like a food drive or social events. Ask them to find an event and present their opinions in class or create a homework assignment around what they choose. You can have your students grade each other anonymously.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Social Media Trends</strong>: Instead of brushing off or punishing students for using social media during class, try using it to engage them. Take part in social media trends by adding social media activities or ice breakers before class. Your students could do a famous dance, add trending punchlines, or rate a trend related to your lesson. You could also use this as a mid-class break because they're probably scrolling through TikTok at that point anyway.</li>
      <li><strong>Ask Open-Ended Questions</strong>: Move away from asking yes or no questions. Instead, ask ones that leave room for discussion and debate. Avoid getting too technical, but make it relevant to the lesson plan. Remember, most of these students may still be in bed or pajamas. You want questions that get their minds off the pillow and into the lesson.</li>
      <li><strong>Get Them to Talk About Themselves</strong>: We don't recommend digging into students' lives but getting them to talk about themselves is an easy way to get their attention and engage them. Draw out the shy ones with questions like where they'd love to vacation or a list of their favorite Netflix shows. Let students exchange playlists, talk about a favorite show, and so on.</li>
      <li><strong>Invite Pets</strong>: Let pets come to the meeting; it'll be the cutest show-and-tell! Give students time to introduce their pets before you dive into the lesson. You can choose to let one person show off per class or two at different times. Pets have a fantastic way of engaging distracted, stressed, and checked-out minds, and they'll help recapture students' attention.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Fun Riddles and Games</strong>: Incorporate riddles and games into your lessons. It'll require everyone's participation and turn a regular class into a fun, engaging one.</li>
      <li><strong>Let Artistry Roam Free</strong>: Whatever the class is, artistic expression has a place in it. Encourage your students to sketch their view of a problem or write a paragraph about their week. Ensure no one feels pressured to do anything. Make it clear that none of this goes towards a grade, and it is simply in good fun.</li>
      <li><strong>Invite Students to Emotionally Check-in</strong>: With an increased awareness of students' mental health since the pandemic, many teachers have given room for emotional check-ins in their classes.</li>
      <li><strong>Play the Lyric/Quote Game</strong>: Class discussion forums can be bland; Q&A sessions are silent. An easy way to revive these is through the lyric/quote game.</li>
      <li><strong>Provoke Discussion with Controversial Questions</strong>: Trying to start a class discussion is challenging. Trying to start one in a virtual classroom is even more challenging. It feels like students check out much faster. The easiest way to instigate the discussion is to drop a fiery opinion.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Mix and match these 10 tips to increase class engagement with your students. You can use them as a base for an activity or as the activity itself. Be careful to read the room and apply them accordingly.</p>

    alt: `High school students discussing`,
    summary: `High school students often focus on themselves, but it's crucial to nurture empathy too. Here are 8 actionable tips for educators to promote empathy among high schoolers.`,
    tags: `education, high school, empathy, student development`,
    keywords: `high school, empathy, students, education, fostering empathy, student development, teaching strategies, empathy in education`,
    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>High school students spend a lot of time thinking about who they are and who they will be in the world. They think about their upcoming decisions about college and careers. All this naturally pushes them toward a lot of concern with “I.” Educators need to help ensure that the “we” stay in the picture as well. And that’s why it’s necessary to encourage empathy in high school.</p>
      <h2>8 Ways to Help High School Students Show Empathy</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Give students a chance to express their feelings about losses.</strong> When adolescents don’t feel like they belong, they feel great despair. Now more than ever, adults must be sensitive to how much loss can destabilise high school students because it shakes their feelings of belonging. Losses in their families, not being able to interact with friends, missing teams and performance groups… and more are being carried by high school students all the time. Particularly when students return in the fall, very early in the school year, show your empathy toward students by giving them an opportunity to write about losses. You can make it personalised, or you can allow it to be hypothetical, in which students will pour their actual feelings into prose, poetry, or other forms of artistic expression.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use the prompt, “How do you think that person/those people felt?”</strong> Regardless of subject area—reading a novel, talking about scientific accomplishments, reviewing events in history, reading stories about the contemporary world—asking students to understand the emotions of the people involved exercises their empathy muscles. After a while, they will start asking themselves this question without your prompting—a key aspect of empathy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Create an exchange program.</strong> Empathy and taking others’ perspectives go hand in hand. So arrange for your students to have regular exchanges—via class-to-class Zoom or the pen-pal approach (whether via old-fashioned paper or email)—with people who come from different backgrounds and situations. Consider partnering with a school overseas. Help with this can come from the European Network for Social and Emotional Competence or the Mandela Washington Fellowship for Young African Leaders through Rutgers University Professor Ronald Quincy. He can help connect teachers with Mandela fellows who are often teachers in Africa. You can also make arrangements with senior citizen centres, youth detention facilities, Veterans Administration centres, the Wounded Warrior Project, and related organisations. The possibilities are endless.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Have students occupy characters from books.</strong> Your students will have fun and learn if you ask them to occupy or become characters they’re reading about. Ask them to portray their posture, speech patterns, and perspective. Then have students compare their classmates’ perspectives on the same characters and discuss why they made their interpretations. For an added challenge, ask your students to create and enact the dialogue they anticipate might happen in upcoming chapters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Listen, really listen.</strong> It’s natural and all too common for students in classes and groups to worry about what they’re going to say and not listen to others. Here is a simple antidote: Ask students to repeat the response of a classmate before giving their answer (“Afghouli said, ‘I think…’”). Cognitive psychologist Irv Sigel, who studied question asking and answering extensively, noted that there is no need to do this all the time. Once you intersperse this kind of request regularly and at varying intervals in a class, students will start to anticipate and listen more carefully.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Assign an essay on “me at my best.”</strong> To help leaven “I” with “we,” ask students to write an essay (in whatever format they are learning in their English classes) with this focus: When am I at my best? With whom and when? How and why does the presence of others help me be better?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask students about the movie that moves them most.</strong> Then, ask them to do the following assignment about it. Once they have done so, they can share in pairs and small groups and report out on one another’s perspectives. This definitely has a broadening effect, as students tend to think everyone will see a “moving movie” the same way that they do.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>What is the movie?</li>
            <li>Summarise the plot.</li>
            <li>Name the main characters and describe their personalities, especially how they treat others.</li>
            <li>Identify three parts of the movie that gave you the strongest emotional reactions. What emotions did you feel and why?</li>
            <li>What was it about the movie that led you to empathise with it so much—to have the reactions intended by the writer, director, and actors?</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Show students how to succeed and fail at interviews.</strong> Throughout high school, students will find themselves in interviews for various kinds of positions, and this will lead to college and career-related interviews in their senior year. Lynne Azarchi, author of The Empathy Advantage and inspiration for this blog, believes students need to know that interviewees are most successful when they can take the perspective of the interviewer. In advisories and group-guidance experiences, time can be devoted to these questions: What are interviewers looking for? What do they not want to see? After getting some discussion by students, be sure these key points are covered:
          <strong>Desirable qualities:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Good formal email communication</li>
            <li>Respectfulness during the whole interview process, including to all staff</li>
            <li>Preparation—knows about the company, business, or school</li>
            <li>Commitment to being a team player</li>
            <li>Willingness to go out of one’s comfort zone</li>
            <li>Concern for others; can speak about interest and involvement in some social, environmental, charitable, or service causes</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Undesirable qualities:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Wandering eyes</li>
            <li>Weak handshake</li>
            <li>Very short answers</li>
            <li>Inability to read and match the interviewer in terms of loudness of voice, speed of speech, posture; disinterest in a long response</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The importance of empathy—and its close cousin, compassion—are becoming more and more clear as we see what’s happening in the world around us. Let’s be sure to prepare our high school students to contribute as more considerate and caring citizens.</p>

    keywords: `teaching U.S. history, diversity in education, inclusive curriculum, teaching techniques, primary sources, classroom diversity`,
    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>Teaching students U.S. history authentically requires educators to delve into race and racism, invite “complexity and hidden narratives” into the conversation, and give students the tools to navigate and make sense of “the truths that are difficult to reconcile with the messages of freedom and democracy,” writes Emily Boudreau for Usable Knowledge, a Harvard Graduate School of Education publication.</p>
  
      <p>“What does it mean to be living on land taken from Indigenous people? How can a nation recognize that many of its institutions were built and made possible by the labor of enslaved people?” Boudreau writes, referencing an inclusive vision of history that asks us to acknowledge the contributions of women, Black, Latinx, Asian, and LGTBQ people, for example. “Because conversations around these hard histories can be challenging, educators need to know how to approach the subject in considered, developmentally appropriate ways.”</p>
  
      <h2>Feature Stories of Resistance and Resilience</h2>
      <p>Historical narratives should strike a balance between examining racism and discrimination but also highlighting “the resilience and resistance of communities throughout history,” so they’re instilling hope in young people, Boudreau writes, but also correcting the narrow, often cursory view of U.S. history that glosses over important figures of resistance like César Chávez, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the disability rights activist Ed Roberts, and Kwame Ture, born Stokely Carmichael.</p>
  
      <p>“It’s imperative that teachers not reinforce a milquetoast version of Black history that is anti-Black because of its erasure of painful truths,” writes Rann Miller, an after-school program director.</p>
  
      <h2>Examine Primary Sources</h2>
      <p>Textbooks tend to gloss over large swaths of history, “without going into much depth or bringing the voices of those who lived through those times to the surface,” writes Boudreau. It’s up to teachers to bring those voices into the classroom via primary source documents “that tell the story of an event using the words of the people who are described by the curriculum.”</p>
  
      <h2>Make Sure Kids See Themselves in Your Classroom</h2>
      <p>Books and curriculum should “reflect the diversity of our world and identities of all students,” in the classroom, writes Boudreau. In the early grades, check in with families and caregivers to gain an understanding of students’ backgrounds, suggests Stang, and make sure kids have opportunities to learn not just about the identities of students in the classroom, but also about diverse cultures and backgrounds that aren’t reflected in the room.</p>
  
      <h2>Teach Hard Histories in Other Classes Too</h2>
      <p>It’s not just the job of history teachers to take on the complex discussions around race and racism. “Including curriculum and sources that deal with both hard histories and narratives of resilience and agency is the job of every teacher, not just those in the history department,” writes Boudreau.</p>
      
      <p>In STEM classes, for example, writes scientist Ainissa Ramirez, it’s critical to “inform [students] about the past.” In English class, make texts from authors who represent a spectrum of racial, cultural, and gender perspectives available, and emphasize the contributions of often marginalized people to American history.</p>

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>Are you feeling overwhelmed by the daily grind of work? You're not alone. In this article, we'll delve into the concept of transitioning to a four-day work week and why it might be the solution to enhancing overall well-being.</p>
  
    <p>Imagine this scenario: the daughter of a friend recently entered the workforce and found herself consumed by the demands of a traditional five-day work week. She lamented, "If this is what work is like, I don’t want to spend my whole life doing it." Many can relate to her sentiment, as the modern employment landscape often leaves little time for leisure or personal pursuits.</p>
  
    <p>But what if there's a better way? Advocates for a shorter work week argue that it could lead to increased productivity and, more importantly, improved well-being. Rather than defining ourselves solely by our jobs, a four-day work week allows for a broader exploration of life's possibilities.</p>
  
    <h2>The Evolution of Work</h2>
  
    <p>Work, as we know it, is a relatively modern phenomenon. For most of human history, our ancestors lived as hunter-gatherers, spending only a fraction of their time on subsistence activities. It wasn't until the advent of agriculture and the industrial revolution that work became synonymous with long hours and toil.</p>
  
    <p>Today, we're still grappling with the legacy of this industrial mindset. However, evidence suggests that longer working hours don't necessarily equate to greater productivity. In fact, countries with shorter work weeks often boast higher levels of well-being and economic success.</p>
  
    <h2>The Case for Working Less</h2>
  
    <p>Working less doesn't mean economic failure. On the contrary, it may lead to a host of benefits, including reduced stress, improved health, and stronger relationships. Moreover, it allows individuals the opportunity to pursue their passions and interests outside of work, leading to a more fulfilling life.</p>
  
    <p>In today's fast-paced world, it's essential to rethink our relationship with work. By prioritizing well-being over constant productivity, we can create a more sustainable and fulfilling future for ourselves and the planet.</p>
  
    <h2>Reimagining the Future</h2>
  
    <p>As we confront pressing global challenges such as climate change, the need to reassess our work culture becomes even more apparent. Embracing a four-day work week could be a step towards a more balanced and sustainable way of life.</p>
  
    <p>Ultimately, whether you're a student entering the workforce or a seasoned professional, it's worth considering the benefits of a shorter work week. After all, life is about more than just work—it's about finding meaning and fulfillment in every aspect of our lives.</p>

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>Last year, a report from the University of Melbourne highlighted the imperative need for a reevaluation of the Australian education system's assessment methods. The aim? To equip students with the essential skills required to thrive in the ever-evolving job market.</p>
    
    <p>Professor Sandra Milligan, leading the study at Melbourne Graduate School of Education (MGSE), emphasized that current assessment practices fail to prepare students adequately for the workforce of the future. This shortfall risks leaving an entire generation ill-prepared for the challenges ahead.</p>
    
    <p>However, the call for reform hasn't gone unheeded. Efforts are underway to revamp assessment systems, focusing on equity, reliability, and swift feedback mechanisms to enhance student performance.</p>
    
    <p>Janison, an edtech company established in 1998 by teacher Wayne Houlden, is at the forefront of this movement. The Sydney-based firm conducts over ten million online assessments annually across 120 countries. Their platform aims to empower educators, students, and policymakers by delivering valuable insights through comprehensive assessment.</p>
    
    <p>Recently, Janison received accreditation as the Australian National Service Provider (NSP) by the OECD for the PISA for Schools assessment. This recognition grants Janison exclusive rights to administer PISA for Schools in Australia for the next two years, signaling a pivotal step towards modernizing assessment practices.</p>
    
    <p>Moreover, Janison collaborates with the NSW Education Department to implement the online Check-in tool, designed to complement existing assessment methods and tailor teaching strategies to individual student needs.</p>
    
    <p>The Check-in tool's success in identifying learning gaps and facilitating immediate interventions has garnered widespread acclaim. Teachers can now address student needs promptly, thanks to the tool's rapid feedback mechanism.</p>
    
    <p>While currently implemented in NSW, other education departments across Australia are closely monitoring the Check-in's rollout, recognizing its potential to transform assessment practices.</p>
    
    <p>David Caspari, CEO of Janison, emphasizes the transformative impact of digital assessment technologies. He highlights the efficiency and insights gained through digitization, enabling educators to optimize teaching practices and improve learning outcomes.</p>
    
    <p>Furthermore, Caspari underscores Janison's commitment to equity in education. By leveraging digital tools, Janison endeavors to bridge the gap between privileged and disadvantaged communities, ensuring equitable access to quality education.</p>
    
    <p>One notable initiative is the adaptation of assessments for visually impaired students, demonstrating Janison's dedication to inclusivity and accessibility.</p>
    
    <p>Looking ahead, Caspari envisions a future where technology not only enhances assessment processes but also narrows the digital divide, ensuring equal opportunities for all students.</p>
    
    <p>In conclusion, the evolution of assessment practices represents a critical step towards preparing students for the challenges of tomorrow's workforce. By embracing digital technologies and prioritizing equity, education systems can empower every student to thrive in an ever-changing world.</p>

    <p>Confession: Teaching in today's classroom environment is no easy feat. Melissa Roy, a seasoned educator, shares her journey of finding solace and inspiration in the teachings of "The Four Agreements" by Don Miguel Ruiz.</p>
    <p>Roy admits, "I haven’t read any books about instructional practice this year because my brain cannot learn one more thing." Instead, she focuses on nurturing her soul and drawing lessons in patience, kindness, and understanding from her reading.</p>
    <p>Returning to old favorites like "The Four Agreements," Roy finds solace in its timeless wisdom, especially pertinent during this challenging year of teaching amid a pandemic. She breaks down the four agreements and shares how they've transformed her classroom interactions.</p>
    <h2>1. BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD</h2>
    <p>Roy emphasizes the power of words, particularly in uplifting struggling students. Instead of reinforcing negative cycles, she chooses to affirm her students' worth and potential. Celebrating successes beyond academics, Roy fosters hope and self-belief.</p>
    <p>To further explore fostering hope and positive beliefs in students, UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science Center offers valuable suggestions.</p>
    <h2>2. DON’T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY</h2>
    <p>Conflict is inevitable, but Roy underscores the importance of not taking things personally. Understanding that students' behaviors often stem from underlying challenges, she responds with compassion and acceptance, defusing difficult situations.</p>
    <p>For additional insights on conflict resolution in the classroom, Rebecca Alber from UCLA provides helpful suggestions.</p>
    <h2>3. DON’T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS</h2>
    <p>Roy warns against the dangers of assumptions, urging educators to embrace each student's individuality. By releasing preconceived notions, she creates space to understand students' unique stories, strengths, and challenges.</p>
    <p>She emphasizes the importance of kindness and grace, recognizing that everyone is doing their best with the resources available.</p>
    <h2>4. ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST</h2>
    <p>Despite the challenges of teaching, Roy advocates for self-compassion and prioritizing what truly matters. Focusing on excellent planning and building relationships, she finds peace in knowing she's doing her best, acknowledging that it's enough.</p>
    <p>As educators navigate the complexities of teaching, Roy's journey reminds us of the transformative power of applying ancient wisdom to modern challenges.</p>

      <p>Mental health is a pressing concern in the modern world, particularly in demanding roles like social work jobs. The constant hustle and bustle of daily life, coupled with technological advancements, have led to heightened stress levels and mental health issues.</p>
      <p>The fight or flight response, a natural reaction to stress, can become overactive in today's society. While this response is beneficial in short bursts, prolonged exposure to stressors can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health.</p>
      <h2>Fight or Flight</h2>
      <p>The fight or flight response is triggered by everyday stressors, causing increased cortisol levels and various symptoms such as decreased learning, muscle tension, and mood swings.</p>
      <h2>Ways to Manage Stress</h2>

        <li><strong>Take Time to Switch Off:</strong> Prioritize relaxation time daily to allow your body to relax and reduce the fight or flight response. Mindfulness practices can also help focus awareness and reduce anxiety.</li>
        <li><strong>Log Off From Life:</strong> Limit exposure to technology, especially after work hours, to give your mind a chance to decompress. Engage in activities that truly relax you, avoiding stimuli that perpetuate stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Moving:</strong> Regular exercise is a proven method to relieve stress and improve mental health. Even simple activities like walking can have significant benefits.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Managing stress is crucial for maintaining mental well-being, especially in high-pressure environments like social work jobs. By implementing these simple strategies, individuals can effectively mitigate the effects of stress and lead healthier, more fulfilling lives.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>Physics education in the United States faces a unique challenge: a shortage of qualified teachers. Many districts, particularly in urban and rural areas, struggle to offer physics courses due to this shortage. Compounding the issue is the fact that most universities produce few physics teachers, leaving a significant gap in the education system.</p>
      <p>Despite these challenges, there are effective strategies for educators without a physics background to teach the subject successfully. Here are three tips:</p>
      <h2>1. Connect with a Physics Community</h2>
      <p>Building a network of support is crucial, especially when teaching outside one's specialty. Educators can find support from colleagues within their school or district, as well as through local or state-level physics teacher associations. Online platforms like Twitter offer opportunities to connect with fellow educators and access valuable resources.</p>
      <h2>2. Focus on Models, Not Math</h2>
      <p>Contrary to common belief, physics is not just for math-oriented students. Emphasizing the process of developing models based on observations and experiments, rather than focusing solely on equations, can make the subject more accessible to all students. Educators can explore teaching models like the Investigative Science Learning Environment to align with Next Generation Science Standards.</p>
      <h2>3. Teach with Humility</h2>
      <p>Approaching physics education as a shared learning experience with students can foster a collaborative classroom environment. Educators should acknowledge their own learning journey and involve students as active participants in the learning process. Practicing demonstrations and experiments beforehand can help ensure smooth delivery in the classroom.</p>
      <p>While teaching physics without a background in the subject may seem daunting, adopting the right mindset and approach can turn it into an exciting adventure for both educators and students alike.</p>

    <p>Saturday 15 May marked the beginning of National Families Week, an occasion which celebrates the vital role that families play in Australian society. Amidst this celebration, concerns loom over the ongoing resource gap between public and private schools, exacerbating issues for disadvantaged youth across the country.</p>
  
    <p>On 11 May, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced $24.4bn for all schools in 2021-22 as part of the Federal Budget. This includes funding for reforms in the government's youth employment services program and initiatives aimed at enhancing social cohesion and diversity. However, the disparity in resources between public and private schools remains a pressing issue.</p>
  
    <p>Mary Malak, CEO of Humanity Matters, highlights the strain on public schools, especially in accommodating disadvantaged and special needs students. She emphasizes the need for a broader approach to ensure all students receive equitable opportunities.</p>
  
    <p>In a nationwide poll by YouGov, over eight in ten Australians expressed concerns about low public school funding, with three-quarters agreeing that the Federal Government should fully fund every school to 100% of the Schooling Resource Standard (SRS).</p>
  
    <p>While Federal Education Minister Alan Tudge asserts that funding for government schools has increased significantly, critics argue that more comprehensive measures are needed to address the resource gap.</p>
  
    <p>The ongoing debate over public school funding underscores the importance of ensuring equitable access to education for all students, regardless of socioeconomic background or school type.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>The end of the school year can be chaotic – from assessments and report writing to camps, productions and final assemblies, teachers have a lot of their plates during this period. With the disruptions of 2020, Term 4 is shaping up to be especially intense this year, and the way we bring it to a close will be even more important.</p>
      <p>As we count down to the end of the final term, here is our advice to help you finish the school year on a high note.</p>
      <h2>Don’t Wrap Up Too Soon</h2>
      <p>While it can be easy to let your schedule relax when you reach the final stretch, but it’s helpful to try and maintain your routine for as long as possible. If students perceive that you are winding down, this may impact their attitude and behaviour in the classroom.</p>
      <p>This doesn’t mean you have to deliver dense, highly-structured lessons right up to the closing bell (there’s nothing wrong with keeping it light and fun after all), but making the most of the remaining learning time in the last few weeks will help students stay focused and engaged.</p>
      <h2>Be Prepared</h2>
      <p>One most effective ways to ease the end-of-year stress is to be prepared. When you’re in the middle of all the final marking, report writing and festive events, finding the time to prepare lesson plans can be difficult. By squeezing in extra prep where you can and having a trusty collection of resources ready to fall back on, you can alleviate some of the pressure while ensuring you’re still able to give your best to your students.</p>
      <p>We have put together a selection of quality lesson planning resources to help you out when you’re short on time in this blog, and there are also plenty of fun holiday-themed activities and ideas available online if you want to mix things up with something seasonal.</p>
      <h2>Take Time to Reflect</h2>
      <p>It’s always beneficial to reflect on the year gone by, but this year it’s more crucial than ever to allow students the opportunity to process, document and share their feelings about the past 12 months. This can serve as a reflection of learning while also providing a valuable way to process the challenges they have overcome. It can be done as a group and/or individually and might take the form of a journal entry, poster, slide show, portfolio or memory book that they can look back on and share.</p>
      <p>As well as reflecting with the students, it’s also important for teachers to do their own reflections as it gives you a chance to see how you’ve grown in your teaching practice and what you’ve learned over the past year. Don’t forget to also use this time to take note of any professional development you have undertaken, as this could come in handy when writing an appraisal or updating your CV.</p>
      <h2>Recognise and Celebrate Achievements</h2>
      <p>Celebrating your students’ achievements is one of the best ways to close out the year with a bang, particularly one that has been filled with so many difficulties. You might invite students to write down something positive about their classmates, as well as think about the personal successes they are most proud of and share them with the class.</p>
      <p>Rather than relying on the awards passed out in the final assembly, you should also make an effort to recognise the accomplishments of all the students individually, especially the ones that have struggled. Whether it was mastering a new concept, adapting well to the remote learning environment, trying again after a mistake or handing in a stand-out project, praising the ways each student has grown will give them confidence that they can take with them into the next year.</p>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Often, the final weeks of the school year can have just as big an impact on the students and teachers as the beginning of Term 1 does. By looking for ways to provide a positive experience, you can ensure everyone leaves for the summer holidays feeling optimistic and will return ready and excited to learn.</p>
      <p>If you’d like to share your strategies for ending the school year well or want to make a fresh start in 2021 and need advice on finding your next teaching job in Victoria, speak to our team of Education recruitment specialists today.</p>

    <p>Hunting for a new job is already challenging, but navigating through misleading tips and guides can make it even more daunting. Here are seven job search tips you should avoid at all costs:</p>
  
    <ol>

      <li><strong>Make Sure Your Interviewer Knows How Much You Want This Job:</strong> Avoid appearing desperate by focusing on asking insightful questions about the role rather than expressing excessive eagerness.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Add a Column in Your Resume Highlighting Testimonials from Previous Employers:</strong> Relying solely on others' praise may signal a lack of self-assurance. Focus on showcasing your own accomplishments and skills.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Ask the Interviewer Why They Would Not Hire You After You Are Done:</strong> Instead of questioning your suitability for the role, conclude the interview with gratitude and follow up with a polite email.</li>
  
      <li><strong>Have Your Reference Letter On You During the Interview:</strong> Keep your reference letter as leverage and only present it when necessary. Treat the interview as a negotiation and maintain control over the process.</li>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
  <h2>Improving Classroom Behavior and Student Engagement with Social and Emotional Learning</h2>
  <p>Many middle school teachers find success using extrinsic reward systems to manage class behavior, but these methods can cause a “What’s in it for me?” attitude among students when they’re asked to do something they should be doing anyway, such as being kind to others. A more intrinsic way to improve class behavior is to use social and emotional learning (SEL) to help students strengthen their relationships with teachers and peers.</p>
  <p>SEL skills are also essential for student self-motivation. Although there was some resistance from students to do their schoolwork before the pandemic, COVID exposed more of that resistance. It stripped away the extrinsic factors that were in place in school systems, leaving students to motivate themselves. Teachers hadn’t taught executive function skills, however, and students were accustomed to being told what to do and how to do it. Students didn’t know how to manage time, so how could they motivate themselves and finish their assignments?</p>
  <h3>SEL and Teacher-Student Connections</h3>
  <p>Teacher-student relationships greatly impact learning, and focusing on the teacher role in SEL can lead to improved student academic performance. A lack of teacher training and comfort with SEL, however, means that student behavior and emotions can remain under the teacher’s radar. Here are some examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A seventh-grade student, Steven, isn’t getting his work done because he’s afraid of not having the right answer and not pleasing his teacher. He freezes up and doesn’t do the assignment.</li>
    <li>A sixth grader, Miguel, does all he can do on an assignment and writes on his homework, “This is the best I can do,” which the teacher had suggested he write when he was stuck. The teacher, however, responds, “I don’t want to hear that.” Miguel is stunned and ashamed, so he may be less likely to speak up and advocate for himself.</li>
    <li>Penny, an eighth grader, has short-term memory loss due to previous traumatic experiences and also is not an auditory learner. After giving long verbal instruction, the teacher asks Penny to repeat the directions. Penny responds, “I don’t remember.” The teacher inevitably gets frustrated at having to repeat the instructions, and Penny feels ashamed and hurt. Rather than realizing it may be helpful for Penny to have written directions she can refer back to, the teacher gets angry.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Teacher attitudes and student experiences like these can influence student self-esteem and confidence when it comes to turning in assignments, and these patterns can last for years if left undetected. SEL must begin with teachers; the more teachers use their own SEL skills in the interactions they have with students, the more students will feel liberated to do the same.</p>
  <h3>Teacher SEL Training</h3>
  <p>Self-reflection is an important tenet of social and emotional learning, enabling teachers to practice their own self-care and promote well-being. When there are problems in the classroom or with others, it’s vital that teachers reflect on the part they may be playing. So, taking time to reflect on our role in problems we may have in our relationships with students can bring us greater awareness as to how we might change our strategies in the future.</p>
  <p>Being self-aware is only one part of the SEL puzzle and overlaps with other SEL components, such as self-regulation. When we’re frustrated or angry, students know it, and they may have a hard time asking for help. Determining ways to tame our anger can also be a part of the self-reflective process that can go a long way in strengthening our relationships with students. These skills can help teachers throughout their career.</p>
  <p>Here are a few questions that teachers can ask themselves to prevent further teacher (and student) turmoil:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can I make the work I assign meaningful to students?</li>
    <li>What is my role in why students aren’t getting their work done?</li>
    <li>How can I spend my time differently to get the results I want from students?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Considering all the tasks that teachers have to fulfill, it can be easy to reach for blame instead of self-reflection. This is especially true when students present challenging behaviors. Rather than raising our voices at students or calling out students in front of others, a better option would be to pause and think of other choices we have. Self-reflection can help us regulate our own behavior so that we can cultivate and prioritize a more caring way to interact with students. The benefits for both teachers and students will be long-term.</p>

    content: `<article class="blog-content">
      <p>A high school principal recently lamented to me that many of his students’ grades were cratering during distance learning. Much of the problem, he observed, was coming from classes whose grades were calculated using points: Work is assigned, work is not received, and the work gets a zero in the grade book. An algorithm takes over. Average these. Weight that. Out spits the failing grade.</p>
      <p>Keeping our students engaged when we can’t serve them in person has, understandably, proven a challenge. For over a year now, teachers all over the country have been Zooming real hard and often feeling disappointed by what they’ve been getting back from students in return. But according to many school leaders I’ve heard from, that problem has been compounded by points-based grading systems.</p>
      <h2>What’s Wrong with Points?</h2>
      <p>Let’s step back: It’s not the points themselves that are the problem. Points are a perfectly valid way to add up the number of right and wrong answers in certain kinds of assessments—some questions do have right and wrong answers.</p>
      <!-- More content here -->
      <h2>Don’t Add Them Up</h2>
      <p>In many classrooms across all subjects, things that are small and routine—quizzes, homework—tend to be scored with points. This is convenient and defensible. When well-conceived, learning routines communicate the value of practice, and it’s important to have data on the quality and quantity of our students’ practice.</p>
      <!-- More content here -->
      <h2>Look for Ways to Apply the Portfolio Concept</h2>
      <p>The essence of a portfolio is simple: It’s a demonstration of skill through the curation of evidence. That’s why portfolios have proven to be such a flexible and effective form of assessment. They can wrap themselves around any kind of evidence (including items that have already been point-scored), and they enroll the learner in the curation of that evidence.</p>
      <!-- More content here -->
      <h2>Use a Rubric for the Course Grade</h2>
      <p>It’s not a coincidence that letter grades, GPAs, and most rubrics operate on roughly the same 4-point scale. In describing those levels, it’s hard to beat this quick guide, as explained by one wise teacher I know: An A means “you nailed it.” A B means “you got it.” A C means “you almost got it.” And a D or F tells us that “something isn’t working here.”</p>
      <!-- More content here -->
      <h2>Keep Asking Students What Might Work Better</h2>
      <p>To be clear, useful, and motivating, an effective grading system needs constant input from its end users. And it pays particular attention to the input from students for whom things are not working well. True, plenty of students will say that a points-based system works fine: They’ve got it figured out, so why change? But those aren’t the students to be designing for—and improving things for students who have been struggling usually improves things for everyone.</p>
      <!-- More content here -->
      <p>We must examine the ways the pandemic caught us off-guard. Many of our grading systems were geared for seat-time. The systems broke down when the seats were empty. Now that we know better, we must retool.</p>
      <p>So take a hard look at the use of points in your grading practice. Try some techniques for containing or even eliminating them. If we come out of this pandemic adding up fewer points, we will have advanced toward an educational system where assessment is for learning, not for sorting.</p>

               <p>Tim Schlosser's journey from English teacher to principal sheds light on the pivotal role content expertise plays in school leadership. As the principal of Tyee High School in SeaTac, Wash., Schlosser brings a unique perspective to the table, bridging the gap between academic standards and effective teaching strategies for ELA teachers.</p>
               <p>While Schlosser's expertise is invaluable for ELA, the question arises: what about other subjects like calculus or Spanish? Schlosser emphasizes that a principal's role isn't to be the expert in all subjects but to ensure that teachers receive the necessary support and development in their respective areas.</p>
               <p>However, the debate around principal's content knowledge persists. While the mantra "good teaching is good teaching" holds true, there's an argument for principals to delve deeper into subject areas beyond their expertise to better support teachers.</p>
               <p>Ann O'Doherty, a former principal, highlights the importance of principals having a solid understanding of curriculum, assessments, and classroom culture. This knowledge enables them to guide teachers effectively across different subjects.</p>
               <p>Susan Korach emphasizes the need for principals to recognize their limitations and collaborate with content experts to fill in the gaps. But Jo Beth Jimerson and Sarah Quebec Fuentes suggest that principals with baseline content knowledge can offer more actionable feedback to teachers.</p>
               <p>Jimerson's research reveals that while common teaching practices are valuable, principals with content knowledge can provide nuanced feedback, enhancing teacher-leader relationships.</p>
               <p>To bridge the content expertise gap, Jimerson proposes practical steps for principals to deepen their knowledge, including focusing on one subject area each year, subscribing to practitioner journals, and engaging in professional learning communities.</p>
               <p>Jack Baldermann's experience at Westmont High School underscores the importance of collaborative learning environments where teacher expertise drives professional development. Baldermann's approach aligns with Jimerson's suggestions, emphasizing the value of content-based professional learning communities.</p>

  <article class="blog-content">
    <p>With over 20 years of experience as a teacher, the stress and burnout experienced by educators are no secret. Research confirms that teachers often face some of the highest levels of job stress across various countries (Stoeber & Rennert, 2008).</p>
  
    <p>Equally important is the understanding that the wellbeing of teachers directly impacts the wellbeing of students (Roffey, 2012). However, with increasing demands on teachers, such as managing approximately 1000 interpersonal contacts daily (Holmes, 2005), the quality of these interactions can significantly influence a teacher's own wellbeing. In essence, teachers wield the power to either uplift or undermine students within their classrooms. This isn't due to a lack of care but rather stems from feeling overwhelmed by societal and self-imposed pressures.</p>
  
    <p>The crux of the matter is clear: teachers require greater support and effective strategies to manage the cognitive and emotional demands of their profession. Armed with evidence-based strategies to enhance their own wellbeing, educators can not only survive but thrive, setting a positive example for their students. Initiatives aimed at fostering student flourishing must start with supporting the wellbeing of teachers.</p>
  
    <p>Fortunately, science offers a pathway forward with proven strategies drawn from positive psychology, both at individual and organizational levels. Positive psychology seeks to integrate hedonic wellbeing (feeling good) and eudaimonic wellbeing (functioning well) by studying optimal human functioning and what constitutes a fulfilling life.</p>
  
    <p>Martin Seligman, a pioneer in positive psychology, proposed the PERMA model as a framework for wellbeing, consisting of Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment. This model serves as pillars supporting individuals in their pursuit of wellbeing. While not prescriptive, exploring each domain of PERMA can unveil simple yet effective strategies to bolster wellbeing.</p>
  
    <p>To start, consider these five reflective questions:</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Positive Emotion:</strong> When are you happiest at work? What emotion do you experience?</li>
      <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> What aspect of your role do you love most? Which strengths do you employ?</li>
      <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Who provides you with the most support at work? Whom do you support?</li>
      <li><strong>Meaning:</strong> What is the most significant aspect of your role to you? Why do you do what you do?</li>
      <li><strong>Accomplishment:</strong> What achievements, big or small, have you made recently?</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>While reflecting on these questions won't eliminate tasks from your to-do list or rectify systemic issues, it can shift your focus towards recognizing what works. These small mindset shifts may lead to more meaningful interactions with students or productive conversations among colleagues. Reflecting on wellbeing support could mark the initial step towards cultivating positive organizational cultures.</p>
  
    <p>For further exploration, delve into Martin Seligman's seminal work, 'Flourish,' which provides foundational insights into enhancing wellbeing. Additionally, online resources offer specific tools aligning PERMA principles with classroom and staffroom strategies.</p>

      <p>In mid-February, three snowstorms knocked out the electricity for thousands of residents in Boyd County, Kentucky. As they waited for up to two weeks for the lights to come on, many residents were left snowbound in their homes in freezing temperatures. Two people died from hypothermia before power was restored.</p>
      <p>The outages added insult to injury for a rural community struggling to keep students connected and engaged in remote learning for the past year, shared Christy Ford, a high school English teacher. With limited cell phone battery, Ford texted her students during the “dark days” to let them know she was thinking about them—and ask them what they’d do first when the power came on.</p>
      <h2>Addressing Hopelessness in Students</h2>
      <p>“During the time virtual school was ‘off the grid,’ I noticed that looking forward seemed to be the best use of my mental energy,” said Ford, who now plans to create a new assignment: “What’s the first thing you’ll do when things return to ‘normal’?”</p>
      <p>While pandemic schooling has always been hard, it’s seemed to get harder as time has gone on, say Ford and other educators, who are desperately looking for ways to help students stay motivated. Teachers have reported that students increasingly see school as irrelevant and feel a sense of hopelessness about the future. Even with vaccinations and school openings increasing, there are reported upticks in youth depression, anxiety, and suicide attempts. Many teachers, too, share a deepening sense of disillusionment after a year of significant upheaval—and what is expected to be a challenging, slow transition back.</p>
      <p>So what can educators do to instill hope in students, especially when many feel hopeless themselves? According to many research studies, people who are hopeful aren’t simply optimists or Pollyannas but are able to think proactively about the future and plan ahead to get there. Research shows that hope is a learnable, measurable skill, and one that has a sizable impact on students' success and persistence in school.</p>
      <h2>Strategies for Cultivating Hope</h2>
      <p>“People always think of hope as ‘squishy,’ but it’s not,” said Crystal Bryce, the associate director of research at the Center for the Advanced Study and Practice of Hope at Arizona State University. “Hope is cognition and a leading motivation that pushes people to act towards their goals. It’s a skill we have to work on and one that we can grow.”</p>
      <p>According to researchers and psychologists like Bryce, small shifts in curriculum, assignments, and tasks can actually have an effect on how students see themselves and their world. By making some adjustments and bringing new activities, teachers can mitigate some of the hopelessness students feel—and, in turn, make themselves feel more hopeful too.</p>
      <h3>Don’t Sweep It Under the Rug</h3>
      <p>To feel more hopeful, address the elephant in the room. Both children and adults should acknowledge and address the tumult they’ve experienced this past year.</p>
      <p>Teachers can have students make time capsules or write letters to their future selves to frame the pandemic as a "moment in time."</p>
      <h3>A Mindset Shift</h3>
      <p>When students have the right frame of reference, educators can prime their brains to be more hopeful, according to research.</p>
      <p>Ask the right questions: A good starting place for teachers is regularly integrating specific question prompts into classroom activities that many already conduct—like morning meetings or entry or exit tickets.</p>
      <h3>Opportunities for Impact</h3>
      <p>It can be a challenge, however, to think optimistically about the future amid so much instability and uncertainty, said Schonfeld and other experts.</p>
      <p>In a classroom, teachers can help combat the feelings of powerlessness by giving students opportunities where they regain a sense of control.</p>
      <p>Hope collages and vision boards, virtual or handmade, can remind students of things that make them feel hopeful.</p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>My takeaway during dark times is I need to model strong and consistent behaviors for my students—even if I’m struggling with the same frustrations and sense of hopelessness myself,” Christy Ford said.</p>

      <article class="blog-content">
        <p>Amidst concerns over the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student mental health, Australian Christian College (ACC) Moreton has taken proactive steps to prioritize student wellbeing. Reports indicate that Australia faces the risk of losing thousands of lives to suicide in the coming years due to pandemic-related challenges.</p>
        <p>Last year saw a significant rise in mental health crises among young people, with a 50% increase in referrals to hospital emergency departments noted by youth mental health service Headspace.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the need for more targeted interventions, ACC Moreton implemented EI Pulse, a 60-second weekly check-in tool, to gather essential data on student wellbeing. Derek Hughes, Head of Student Wellbeing at ACC Moreton, highlighted the impact of this initiative, stating, "EI Pulse collects helpful data on a range of issues, allowing us to implement strategies and programs tailored to our students' needs."</p>
        <p>One of the most crucial aspects of EI Pulse is its ability to provide students with a discreet means of seeking help. By simply responding to the "How are you feeling?" question, students can signal their need for assistance, leading to prompt support from school staff.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the effectiveness of EI Pulse, a student at ACC shared, "I’m able to reach out and communicate with teachers without having to confront, which has been immensely helpful for me."</p>
        <p>Nabil Shaheen, CEO of EI, emphasized the importance of Pulse in supporting at-risk students, stating, "Pulse provides a facility for at-risk students to reach out for help at any time, from any device."</p>
        <p>Beyond aiding individual students, EI Pulse also offers principals unprecedented visibility into student wellbeing, enabling them to identify and address potential issues proactively. This comprehensive insight into student engagement and wellbeing facilitates informed decision-making at both individual and school-wide levels.</p>
        <p>Expanding its impact, EI has partnered with universities to share data, aiming to enhance the wellbeing initiatives across educational institutions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Joe Thurbon, co-founder and CTO of EI, highlighted the significance of this collaboration, stating, "Leaders gain a simple and comprehensive way to understand their school, leading to better engagement and more detailed conversations with students."</p>
        <p>ACC Moreton's commitment to prioritizing student wellbeing amidst challenging times serves as a testament to the effectiveness of targeted initiatives like EI Pulse in supporting student mental health.</p>

    <article class="blog-content">
      <p>We know COVID-19 and its associated changes to our work and learning habits caused a marked increase in the use of technology. More surprising, perhaps, is the impact these lockdowns have had on children’s and young people’s self-reported enjoyment of books and the overall positive impact this has made on reading rates.</p>
  
      <p>A recent survey from the UK, for example, showed children were spending 34.5% more time reading than they were before lockdown. Their perceived enjoyment of reading had increased by 8%.</p>
  
      <p>This seems logical — locked down with less to do means more time for other activities. But with the increase in other distractions, especially the digital kind, it’s encouraging to see many young people still gravitate towards reading, given the opportunity.</p>
  
      <p>In general, most children still read physical books, but the survey showed a small increase in their use of audiobooks and digital devices. Audiobooks were particularly popular with boys and contributed to an overall increase in their interest in reading and writing.</p>
  
      <p>There is no doubt, however, that digital texts are becoming more commonplace in schools, and there is a growing body of research exploring their influence. One such study showed no direct relationship between how often teachers used digital reading instruction and activities and their students’ actual engagement or reading confidence.</p>
  
      <p>What the study did show, however, was a direct, negative relationship between how often teachers had their students use computers or tablets for reading activities and how much the students liked reading.</p>
  
      <p>These findings suggest physical books continue to play a critical role in fostering young children’s love of reading and learning. At a time when technology is clearly influencing reading habits and teaching practices, can we really expect the love of reading to be fostered by sitting alone on a digital device?</p>
  
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-url" alt="Children reading books">
        <figcaption>Reading alone on a digital device is no substitute for the real thing.</figcaption>
      </figure>
  
      <h2>The Limitations of eBooks</h2>
  
      <p>In schools and homes we often see eBooks being used to support independent reading. As teachers and parents, we have started to rely on these tools to support our emerging readers. But over-reliance has meant losing the potential for engagement and conversation.</p>
  
      <p>Studies have shown children perform better when reading with an adult, and this is often a richer experience with a print book than with an eBook.</p>
  
      <p>Reading when we’re young is still a communal experience. My own seven-year-old is at the age when reading to me at night is a crucial part of his development as a reader. Relying on him to sit on his own and read from his device will never work.</p>
  
      <p>This is not to deny the usefulness of eBooks. Their adoption in schools has been led by the desire to better support learners. They provide teachers with an extensive library of titles and features designed to entice and motivate.</p>
  
      <p>These embedded features provide new ways of helping children decode language and also offer vital support for children with special needs, such as dyslexia and impaired vision.</p>
  
      <p>The research, however, suggests caution rather than a wholesale adoption of eBooks. Studies have shown the extra features of eBooks, such as pop-ups, animation and sound, can actually distract the learner, detracting from the reading experience and reducing comprehension of the text.</p>
  
      <h2>The Book as Object</h2>
  
      <p>Real books may lack these interactive features but their visual and tactile nature plays a strong role in engaging the reader.</p>
  
      <p>Because books exist in the same physical space as their readers — scattered and found objects rather than apps on a screen — they introduce the role of choice, one of the big influences on engagement.</p>
  
      <p>While generally a reluctant reader, my child loves to flick through books and look at the pictures. He might not necessarily read every word, but books such as Dog Man, Captain Underpants and Bad Guys have provided a fantastic opportunity to engage him.</p>
  
      <p>We have even managed to link reading with our children’s favourite online games. Their Minecraft manuals have become valuable resources and are even taken to friends’ houses on play-dates.</p>
  
      <p>Many of our books are not in the best shape, evidence they are lived with and loved. Second hand shops and school fairs provide a cheap option for adding variety, and libraries are also valuable for supplementing the home shelves.</p>
  
      <h2>Keeping it Real</h2>
  
      <p>But cuts to library budgets and collections, such as have been announced recently by Wellington Central Library, threaten to further undermine the role of the physical book in children’s lives.</p>
  
      <p>School libraries, too, are often the first space to be sacrificed when budgets and space restrictions tighten. This encourages the uptake of digital books and further reinforces a reliance on technological alternatives.</p>
  
      <p>Of course, digital technology plays an important role in supporting children to engage and learn, often in powerful new ways that would otherwise be impossible.</p>
  
      <p>But in our haste to adopt and rely on “digital solutions” without clear justification or consideration of their effective use, we risk undervaluing the power of objects made from paper and ink.</p>
  
      <p>As we emerge from a pandemic that has accelerated digital progress, we can’t let these developments obscure the place of real books in real — as opposed to virtual — lives.</p>

    <p>Growth mindset is a crucial aspect of academic success, yet many struggle with how to foster it effectively. In this guide, we provide a practical checklist to help you cultivate a growth mindset for yourself or your students.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Embrace Your Imperfections</h2>
    <p>Recognize that imperfections are opportunities for growth, not shortcomings. Start by identifying areas for improvement and take small steps towards progress.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What about myself do I know needs improving?</li>
      <li>Why is this important to me?</li>
      <li>Why is it important to others whom I am connected to?</li>
      <li>How and where will I choose to begin?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Upload a New Personal Belief</h2>
    <p>Shift your mindset by adopting empowering beliefs about yourself and your potential for growth. Replace old, limiting beliefs with affirmations that align with your goals.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What kind of personal belief would benefit me?</li>
      <li>Is there an old belief I can upgrade?</li>
      <li>How can I incorporate this belief into my daily life?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <!--Remaining steps omitted for brevity-->
    
    <h2>10. Redefine Your Genius</h2>
    <p>Acknowledge your unique talents and accomplishments, celebrating your journey and potential for further growth. Recognize that genius is not innate but cultivated through effort and perseverance.</p>
    <p>Ask yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What have I done in my life that I consider truly remarkable?</li>
      <li>How have these accomplishments enriched me as a person?</li>
      <li>What else can I achieve?</li>

  <article class="blog-content">
    So you’ve been invited for an interview for your dream ethical job! You’ve prepared with answers to some of common interview questions, you’ve practiced the STAR method, and you may have even done some mock interviews.
    But do you know which questions your potential employer can’t legally ask you? And have you considered how you might respond in the awkward situation that you get asked one of them?
  
    <h2>Educate and Inform</h2>
    Up until 1975, employers could take just about anything into consideration when assessing a candidate for a role. But the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act (1975) – passed by the Whitlam Government – declared it illegal for:
    Any employer to treat any person seeking employment less favourably than other persons in the same circumstances by reason of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the person so seeking employment.
    Since 1975, there have been several more Commonwealth and state/territory acts passed to ensure equal opportunity for everyone.
    For example in Victoria, section 107 of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) states:
    A person must not request or require another person to supply information that could be used by the first person to form the basis of discrimination against the other person.
    So what does that mean in practical terms?
    It means it’s illegal for a potential employer to ask you questions like:
  
    <ul>
      <li>How old are you?</li>
      <li>Are you pregnant or planning to start a family?</li>
      <li>Who do you vote for?</li>
      <li>Do you have a physical or mental disability?</li>
      <li>What’s your ethnic background?</li>
      <li>Are you a member of a union?</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Solve a Problem or Answer a Question</h2>
    There are a few exceptions to the rules above.
    In the Fair Work Act there’s an exception which allows employers, or potential employers, to request information for a non-discriminatory reason such as the inherent requirements of the particular position. For example if the role requires heavy lifting, they may ask if you are physically fit for the position.
    In addition, each state has a body like Anti-Discrimination NSW or the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) which can grant temporary exemptions, allowing discrimination to be lawful in some circumstances.
  
    <h2>Engage and Inspire Action</h2>
    But as a general rule, you should not be asked questions about any personal attributes that are not relevant to your ability to perform the role.
    If you think your interviewer has asked an unlawful question, what should you do?
    You can refuse to answer – but if it’s your dream job, it may be tricky to flat out refuse.
    It’s best to assume that the employer is unaware of the law – which it’s common for small not-for-profit organisations that don’t have experienced HR or legal advisors to not be across all the details of employment law.
    Start by asking as politely as possible how the question relates to the role – for example: “Good question – I’m just wondering how that relates to this role though?”
    This will hopefully cause the interviewer to realise what they have done and withdraw the question.
    Or, it may help them to clarify for you whether the question asked was actually unlawful. Extra context from the interviewer may reveal that the question was asked for a non-discriminatory reason after all.
    If that doesn’t work, saying something like “I’m not sure that I need to answer that question” is a polite but firm way to stand your ground in an uncomfortable – but hopefully rare – situation.
  
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    Knowing what your potential employer is not allowed to ask during an interview can occasionally be just as important as preparing for what they probably will ask you. Being prepared with a response to most questions should make you feel more confident and able to steer the interview where you want it to go.
